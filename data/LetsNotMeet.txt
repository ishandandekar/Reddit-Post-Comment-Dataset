##### b"Great, now I have something in my eyes. They won't stop watering. You are an awesome person.\n\nI met an autistic kid once while I was working as a furniture repair tech.  I came to the house and the issue was the arm of their sofa was collapsed. It turned out that it was the autistic boys favorite spot to sit, stand, lay, and jump on. I could have just walked out and said the customer had broken it and it wasn't covered under warranty. Instead I spent a few hours turning that sofa arm into the most sturdy and comfortable item of furniture in the entire house. Several 2x4s, thick foam padding, and long wood screws later and that kid had the best spot in the house. It would have taken a sledge hammer to break that arm down again.\n\nAfter I let him roll my van windows down about 50 times (he really liked power windows) he gave me a hug and I left. His mother called me the next day and insisted I stop by the house as soon as possible, she wanted to thank me. I told her that wasn't at all necessary but she was relentless. I stopped by on my way home and she forced, seriously I tried to decline, a $100 bill in my hand with tears in her eyes.\n\nI know I'm not a very good story teller but I love thinking about how I helped them out and how much they appreciated it. I just wanted to share. "

##### b'As someone who has a sibling with autism, this made my heart so warm. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a world where my little sister was without me, my brother, or my parents. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to know that even if she walks up to a strangers door step, eating whatever she finds on the way, that she could be welcome into that stranger\xe2\x80\x99s home. Go Tom and go you! \n\nThanks! This brightened my day! '

##### b'This took a very pleasant turn in the end! I felt like such a jackass when it was revealed that he was autistic because I was dead set thinking in my head that the behavior had to be due to drugs, mostly thanks to the popular nature of this sub. You are so very sweet to see him every Sunday. This story made me so happy!'

##### b'As sweet as this story is, I sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s fake. Some of the facts in it are complete bullshit. I guess this is an easy way to get attention and sympathy from naive strangers though. If it is real though, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful story. '

##### b'* The man that caused a traumatizing experience for you as a child shows up 16 years later. You had justification to call the police, but you invite him into your home to keep him calm.\n\n* When faced with calling the police or the mental health facility, you chose the far less traumatizing option.\n\n* This could have all been put behind you, but you make a deal that he can visit regularly.\n\nYour compassion and the way you handled this situation are honorable. The world needs people like you.'

## I went down on my cousin during quarantine. [MF]
#### b'I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a fair few of you who really like the backstory, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a good bit of it (probably too much, I got a little carried away). For those of you looking for the hot and heavy section, scroll on down till you see the second set of ---.\n\n\\---\n\nThis happened one week into quarantine, a Wednesday, so about two weeks ago. My work dropped me down to part time because of the Coronavirus so I work 10 hour days on Monday and Friday. My cousin Elizabeth, or Liz, who is currently attending her first year of college near me, instead of returning home to an already packed, loud, and chaotic house with her 5 younger siblings asked if she could stay in the spare bedroom of my two-bedroom apartment. I was hesitant at first for financial reasons. My wife and I finalized our divorce almost 3 months ago and meeting rent on half a salary instead of two AND feeding myself was going to me rough, let alone feeding my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s kid as well. However, my uncle is in a much better place financially and offered to cover my rent, all of it, for the next two months even if this situation blows over in less time for letting Liz stay with me. Some of her siblings have health issues and I think he was afraid she might carry something back into their house.\n\nSo, two weeks ago, I saw my younger cousin for the first time in about 8 years. She was 11 the last time I saw her. She was lanky and awkward, like a small girl growing into a spider\xe2\x80\x99s body, all limbs. She\xe2\x80\x99s always been really sweet, helping her parents with her younger siblings, giving up weekends so her parents could get away and have a mini vacation in the middle of the year. She likes to bake and has an affinity for remembering peoples favorite foods and allergies. Overall, she just seems to be thinking about others first all the time, super cool kid.\n\nIn the 8 years I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen her, she grew a fair bit taller, probably about 5\xe2\x80\x9910\xe2\x80\x9d and kept a slim figure. Strong arms and calloused hands from rock climbing and bouldering almost every weekend, heavy brown hair she usually wears in a braid, and the same bright blue eyes she\xe2\x80\x99s always had. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring much with her, just her laptop, her Switch, and a suitcase full of clothes. I keep the house pretty tidy, so her modest number of belongings didn\xe2\x80\x99t crowd the apartment at all.\n\nI thought it would be awkward before she showed up, but it turns out we share a good bit in common. We listen to the same kinds of music, enjoy playing board games together, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind the odd day where we just entirely ignored each other and did our own thing. Movies became a nightly tradition pretty quickly. Around 6, we would each pick a movie we thought the other person might like, watch one, make dinner, and watch the other. Honestly, my favorite part of Liz being there was the help in the kitchen.\n\nMy ex-wife grew up eating cereal, junk food, and frozen dinner. While I had my fair share of junk food and pre-made pizza, I also ate a ton of good home cooked meals, and so had Liz. Admittedly, it was usually leftovers with something we made fresh, like rolls to go with leftover casserole, stuff like that, but making dinner with Liz each night was the beginning of the end for me. I felt myself reaching out to touch her lower back like I had with the few times my wife and I actually worked together in the kitchen or caught myself just staring at the back of her neck, her hair tied up while she focused on some mundane task like chopping up an onion and resisting the urge to gently kiss her on the shoulder.\n\nLast Monday was the first time I caught an idea that she might be interested in me. After the first movie of the night, Liz left to take a shower to wash off a run she had taken earlier that day while I threw together a pizza. Right after her shower she surprised me by walking into the living room with just her towel on and asked me how the pizza was turning out. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to lie to you and say that I kept my surprise hidden and acted as if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mostly naked 18 year old suddenly standing in front of me, but after looking her up and down, my eyes lingering on her bare shoulders, then on her small breasts framed by the towel, the hem of the arguably too-short-for-her-height towel that ended just below her hips and all the long, sculpted legs that followed, each location for a few moments too long I tripped over my eloquent reply of \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d like a professional middle schooler. \n\nLiz just smirked, gave me a crooked smiled, and walked back to the bathroom saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell it smells really good!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt took me a while to regather myself after seeing so much skin, but I was able to rebuild my composure and push thoughts of certain barely covered areas into a small but sturdy cage and adjust my pants. As I was pulling the pizza out Liz walked back into the living room, thankfully wearing more clothes, an old baggy hoodie that was one of her favorites and some dark black running shorts. She sat down on the couch and buried her nose in her phone while I finished up in the kitchen. Thankfully, it seemed, she was not to concerned with my lingering eyes and I tried to forget the recent image of so much perfect skin.\n\nI cut us a few slices of still hot pizza, brought them out, and started up the movie thinking it was an odd prank she was pulling or just a joke to throw me off while a small, but loud part of my mind hoped it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke at all. Part way through the movie I noticed Liz was back on her phone off and on, probably texting one of her quarantined friends from college but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay much attention to her and tried to focus on the movie. At some point she stretched out on the couch, head on one arm rest and legs bent, and her feet pressed up against my leg. She kept shifting her legs trying to get comfortable until I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWant to stretch them out?\xe2\x80\x9d and patted the tops of my legs.\n\nShe just smiled at me and stretched them out, letting them her feet rest on my lap. I instinctively shifted my hands out from under my blanket and started massaging her cold feet before I realized what I was doing and froze. I slowly looked over and saw her staring at me, a questioning, but not uncomfortable  look on her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to massage Nicole\xe2\x80\x99s (ex-wife) feet all the time like this, just instinct, sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d And I started to desperately search for a new place for my hands.\n\nLiz spoke up for the first time since the movie started, laughing a little as she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all, it actually feels really nice, I went on a long run while you were at work, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear any complaints from me.\xe2\x80\x9d And so, I kept massaging her feet, listening to her breathing, and paying almost no attention to the movie.\n\nEventually, her feet were as warm as my hands and I started moving down her lower legs, giving her calves some attention. This elicited a light moan from Liz, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would Nicole leave this?\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was louder than she expected because I saw her head shoot up and look at me to see if I reacted. I just glanced over and gave her a weak smile but didn\xe2\x80\x99t comment. I could feel her tense under my touch though, she felt bad for saying it.\n\nI turned the movie down a little and said without looking over, \xe2\x80\x9cShe and I just wanted different things. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to overshare, but we both wanted kids and it turns out that I can\xe2\x80\x99t. We talked about adoption but after a while I could tell she wanted her own kids, eventually she started talking about finding a sperm donor but I was fairly adamant about just adopting, I felt like it was a sign that we should adopt and she very much didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We found out about a year ago and that was kind of the beginning of the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was pretty quiet for a while as we both just quietly watched the rest of the movie and I continued rubbing her feet and legs. At this point I had successfully forgotten about the towel incident. The movie ended and credits were scrolling when Liz pulled her feet off my lap and sat up, stretching long arms arching above her tiled-back head. Her neck incredibly exposed and amazingly bare in the low light of the mostly dark living room with her hair in her braid behind her head.\n\nShe stood up, shuffled over closer to me, and sat down, our legs touching through the blanket I still had over my leg. Without looking over to me, just looking forward she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really glad you\xe2\x80\x99re letting me stay with you, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice being in a peaceful place for once. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I made you think about Nicole, I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d He voice trailed off.\n\nI glanced over slightly, just barely turning my head, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it, even though the divorce finalized about 2 months ago we both knew it was coming for a while, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of time to process everything and move on, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that painful anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWe sat in relative silence as the credits scrolled, just the music behind the credits filled the void, but it was strangely peaceful. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to fill the silence and it was really nice just sitting with someone who clearly cared. Eventually Liz broke the silence, shifting in her seat and turning to face me directly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks for the massage,\xe2\x80\x9d I started to turn to face her and make some lame comment but she reached across my chest with one arm, behind my neck with the other, pulled my head gently sideways, and kissed me on the cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt really nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer breath on my neck as she moved closer to me, the surprise contact of just a simple touch across my chest, and her warm lips pressed against my cheek sent a cool fire running down my legs and I could feel myself reacting. Thank god for blankets and semi constrictive jeans\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShe lingered for a few moments and I could tell she was staring at me, searching for a reaction. I knew I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay there for long and make a good decision so I gently took and moved her hands off my neck, stood up, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI still need shower, mind putting the pizza away?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiz gave me a sad smile in the low light of the living room and nodded. I very pointedly did not run to the bathroom, turned the shower on cold, and stripped out of my clothes. I suppose now is a good time to describe what I saw staring back at me in the mirror. I\xe2\x80\x99m about 6\xe2\x80\x99 even, keep my head shaved because it started getting thin in high school and got very thin after and I have a decent beard that I take pretty good care of to compensate. My body shows that I bike to work on nice days, hit the work gym through the winter, and go on the occasional hike, but I also drink too many lattes and really like good pasta. Prime dad bod from what I understand. My quite average dick had relaxed a little bit from Liz\xe2\x80\x99s kiss, but was still resting at about half mast, hoping for release. I jumped into the shower and turned my chest into the cold water to hopefully knock some sense into my foggy head.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m used to taking cold showers because the water heater in this apartment sucks and Nicole always took long showers before I took mine, but it helped dull my senses and help shove some of my thoughts of Liz down. I had just started to lather up after putting conditioner in my beard when I heard Liz knock, crack open the bathroom door, and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cMind if I brush my teeth real fast?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout waiting for much of a response from me she opened the door and grabbed started brushing her teeth. Once she finished and rinsed her mouth out she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you taking a cold shower right now?\xe2\x80\x9d The lack of steam and cooler bathroom had given me away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d I said with a question mark evident on my voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy a cold shower?\xe2\x80\x9d She asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey help me get to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d I lied, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly why.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe seemed to accept my lame excuse and left the bathroom as I finished lathering up my body. I rinsed my beard and the rest of my body, toweled off, wrapped myself up, brushed my teeth, and sneaked into the kitchen to grab a glass of water. I figured that Liz was already in bed or in her room, but I found her playing her switch on the TV with the volume low. I tried to play it off and just walk get my glass of water and head to bed but I could tell Liz was watching me as I walked into the kitchen, grabbed my water, and made my way back down the hallway. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the turntables!\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed at me as I made my way down the hallway.\n\nDespite the cold shower, thoughts of Liz kept me up for at least an hour, but I was able to get to sleep eventually.\n\n\\---\n\nThe following morning Liz slept in and I made myself busy cleaning up the kitchen and starting on breakfast once it hit 9. Breakfast burrito stuff was just about done so I knocked on Liz\xe2\x80\x99s door to let her know but didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a response. I cracked the door open and called in without looking, \xe2\x80\x9cYou up, breakfast is about ready.\xe2\x80\x9d But I got no response. I opened the door a bit more and peered in to find her still asleep, covered disheveled, clearly not the most peaceful of sleep. I walked in and gently touched her shoulder to shake her awake,\n\nShe started to wake up a bit and I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to get up and eat some breakfast or do you want to sleep in a bit?\xe2\x80\x9d She rolled over and took a deep breath in, seeing me standing over her, and smiled a big, still-waking-up smile as she sat up. She was too fucking adorable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get up now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said between a long stretch and a yawn, \xe2\x80\x9cIs food done now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m finishing it all up now, so like 5 minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiz flopped back down, hands above her head and her hair a mess all around her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she smiled up at me, stretching again causing the hem of her hoodie to move up, revealing a section of smooth, bare stomach, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be out soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRight after breakfast I got called into work, some orders mixed up and they needed extra help getting packets sent out before mid-week. I figured the extra hours and a little time away from Liz would be good to help clear my head. I told Liz I\xe2\x80\x99d be home kind of late and to not wait for me for dinner, leftovers would be fine with me, maybe a single movie. Well, the mess up at work was worse than I expected, and I ended up getting home right after 9pm stressed and ready for a shower. Liz was still up and asked if I wanted her to warm up some food while I was in the shower, I was more than willing for that.\n\nOne quick, hot shower later I walked into the living room to find a cup of hot tea and a plate of warm pizza sitting on the floor in front of the couch with Liz sitting on the couch behind. She pointed at the ground in front of her and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s payback time!\xe2\x80\x9d She made a massaging motion with her hands.\n\nMassages are good in my eyes even when they\xe2\x80\x99re bad, just getting touched and having someone focus on you in a mainly physical way is great. Massages, when they\xe2\x80\x99re great, are fucking amazing. Liz goes bouldering a lot, and she has some freakishly strong hands even for a climber, so when she started working my shoulders and neck I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything except the exact moment we were in. Liz found the perfect place between pleasure and pain and there were moments where I was about to wince away from the pressure to let her know that it was a bit too much but she seemed to know, backing off just enough to ride that line. At some point, she tugged at the collar of my shirt and without thinking I pulled it off so she would have direct access to my skin.\n\nAfter a while, my pizza and tea gone cold by this point, she reached down my arm pulled it up and started massaging my right arm. It was weird at first but she knew what she was doing. She told me this was something her and her friends do after particularly difficult weekends. She worked her way all the way down from my shoulder, through my upper arm, lower arm, and finally massaged out my hand, popping each of my fingers individually. That was an entirely new experience for me, having someone else pop my fingers, but again, she knew what she was doing. She switched to my left arm and massaged it the same way, shoulder to hand, popping the fingers at the end. I thought the what-felt-like-hours-long massage was over but she tilted my head back onto her knees and started massaging my forehead gently, moving down to my temples and running her fingers through my beard. Guys, it was heaven on earth.\n\nMy eyes were closed so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her kiss until she pressed her lips against my forehead and lingered for just a few moments. She leaned down close to my ear and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I think you owe me, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI tilted my head to the side and kissed the inside of her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah I guess I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe ran her fingers over my shoulders and over my chest just a little bit while looking me right in the eyes and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay your debt tomorrow, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty late.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she lifted my head up so I sat up straight, stood up, and stepped over me as I sat on the floor. I watched her ass bounce just a bit in her running shorts as she walked down the hall towards her bedroom. She paused at her door, looked back at me, and I swear I saw her bite her lip before she disappeared into her bedroom. I laid my head back onto the couch where she was sitting, the heat of her legs still radiating from the couch. I thought about Liz in a new light and didn\xe2\x80\x99t try and stop it while I drank cold tea and ate cold pizza.\n\nIt took me even longer to fall asleep.\n\n\\---\n\nWednesday morning, I woke up to the front door closing. I poked my head out of my bedroom door and saw Liz\xe2\x80\x99s running shoes missing from the shoe rack near the door. Some people just need to jog I guess. I laid back down in bed and dozed, falling back asleep and waking to new thoughts of Liz. I woke up more fully when I heard the front door close again and poked my head out to see Liz breathing heavy, bundled up in sweats and a jacket to fight off the cold morning air. It gets pretty cold where we\xe2\x80\x99re at some mornings.\n\nShe pulled her headphones out and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to wake you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in and out. You want me to balance the scales after a shower?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\nLiz closed her eyes, sighed, and nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds great, I get tense after running in the cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile she was in the shower I got a few things ready. I stripped my bed down to the mattress cover, sheets needed to be washed anyway, laid out a beach towel I had on the bed, got some of the rubbing oils I had bought for Nicole that, it turns out, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in at all and laid them out on my bedside table. I sat on the edge of my bed trying to find some relaxing music while I waited. I heard the water turn off after some time and Liz walked by in just her towel again. She stepped back out of her room into the hallway, a bit of moisture still clinging to her neck, her hair wrapped up in a towel \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you setting up in here?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou upped the game last night, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in debt forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe raised an eyebrow at me, \xe2\x80\x9cWell I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in in just a few, let me put some clothes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few moments later after I started playing some music from my computer and moved to the head of the bed Liz walked in wearing some sweats and a sports bra. She sat down cross-legged on the towel with her mostly bare back to me. She glanced at me over her shoulder, her hair tied up in a messy bun, her light dusting of freckles on the bridge of her nose uncovered by any makeup. \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI poured a little oil into my hands and warmed it up and, starting where her sports bra crossed her back, moved up her spine to the base of her neck and started massaging. I felt her sigh deeply and lean back into my hands. The small upper portion of her back, framed by her bra straps was soon completely massaged, so I moved my hands under her straps, waiting for a reaction. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice any reaction so I pulled her straps off of her shoulders and let them rest on her arms and worked her shoulders for a while.\n\nLiz spoke up for the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you close your eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI was lost in the feeling of her smooth skin and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI closed my eyes, hands still on her shoulders, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay\xe2\x80\xa6 Now what.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSoon I felt her pulling her bra off past my hands. I felt her weight shift and she moved a few things around. It felt like hours, my topless cousin so close to me while I waited in self-imposed darkness, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, open up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiz was lying on her stomach on the towel she had pulled to the side facing the head of the bed turned to face me, \xe2\x80\x9cBras just get in the way, right?\xe2\x80\x9d She was nervous, I could tell. There was a bit of shake to her voice so I tried to set her at ease.\n\nI laughed a little bit, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all, they do get in the way that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI moved so over her so I  kneeling over her upper legs and poured a little more oil into my hands. I heard somewhere that you should give a massage in percentages, split wherever you\xe2\x80\x99re massaging into a big grid and work each spot the same amount. I tried to mentally break her back into 50 sections and spend about 10 seconds for each section. Starting low, I worked my fingers into the muscle just above her hips, I worked my way just a bit lower towards the center of her back and moved up her spine, adding oil as I needed it. Soon I was pressing into her shoulder blades, working the dense muscle she had there. The sun at this point was cutting through the partially open blinds and landing on her back, causing her skin to glisten. I moved my hands down to her lower back and slowly moved may hands up her sides, just tracing her skin, not pressing with much force at all. I ever so gently grazed the sides of her breasts with my fingertips and I could hear her breathing catch, then increase a bit.\n\nLiz bounced her legs a bit beneath me, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you do my feet and legs again? It felt really nice last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure thing, do you want to change into shorts then? Your sweats will get in the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiz reached under her stomach and pulled her pants string, loosening the waist. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can just take them off if that\xe2\x80\x99s okay with you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI stood up off the bed, her feet were almost dangling off the edge of the bed at this point, and pulled the waist of her pants down. She was wearing simple panties, dark blue, underneath her sweats. As I pulled, she raised her butt into the air slightly to make it easier. Once the pants waist was near her knees, she pressed her hips into the bed lifting her knees slightly so I could remove them entirely. I tossed them to the head of the bed and poured more oil into my hands. I started at the heels of her feet, gently massaging where the tendon connects at the heel and moved up to the balls of her feet, working oil between each of her toes. I moved past her ankles and massaged her calves starting at the knee and worked my way back towards her feet. Once I reached her feet, I poured more oil into my hands and moved my hands very slowly, it around 2 minutes, from the base of her feet past, her calves, behind her knees, along her hamstrings, and stopped just below her panties and began to massage back down to her knees.\n\nI could hear her breathing getting deeper and more forced and I could tell she was getting turned on and I could feel myself reacting as well growing from the half-mast state I had been in for the last few hours to full hardness hearing her react to my hands. Once I reached her knees I lifted my hands entirely, surprising her by starting right at the base of her ass again, this time though I intentionally grazed the hem of her panties, moving just a bit further up than last time and made my way down towards her knees again, though this time much faster. I ran my hands up her legs again, this time, massaging the point just below her panties and then running my fingers just under the hem, massaging the base of her ass for a few moments.\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to push things any further, part of me feared I already had until Liz turned her head and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCould you massage my quads as well? They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty tense after my run this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d She propped herself up a bit on her elbow and turned more fully towards me, her breasts were still pressed into the bed, but only barely hidden. She looked into my eyes and I could tell she was wondering if this was okay or not, but clearly wanting to continue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\xe2\x80\x9d I responded, \xe2\x80\x9cFlip on over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd so she did, Liz rolled over, careful to stay on the towel and not get oil on the mattress cover. Her small breasts were imprinted slightly from the towel and her small nipples were stiff, just asking to be touched. I was wearing athletic shorts so when I climbed onto the bed and kneeled over her lower legs to get a better angle, she no doubt saw my arousal pulling at the loose fabric. I started at the tops of her legs, just below her hips and just traced under the hem of her panties first but quickly moved down and worked the entire muscle. Keeping my eyes on the task at hand was hard with so many excellent places to look. The slowly smoothing skin of her breasts, her tense nipples, and the tiny beads of sweat gathering on her forehead. The points of her hip bones against her skin, the lines on the edge of her panties disappearing between her legs, and the slightly wet spot in the center of her underwear. \n\nAfter a short time I stopped massaging and placed my hands further up the bed, on either side of Liz and leaned forward bringing my head close to hers and whispered in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cIf this is too much you can tell me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop okay?\xe2\x80\x9d I could feel Liz\xe2\x80\x99s hands touch my hips, run up my sides under my shirt, grab my shirt and pull it towards my head. I took the hint and sat up, pulling my shirt over my head. She grabbed my arm before I could sit back, pulled me in with one hand on the back of my head, and kissed me. Her soft lips tightly closed at first, pressing against mine firmly, but not crushing my lips against my teeth. We continued to kiss, bodies apart for the most part, but connected at the lips. Soon her mouth parted with mine and our tongues explored each other\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Her lips were warm, hot even, and her mouth tasted clean, slightly sweet. She bit at my lip and her breathing got heavy. Her hands ran down my chest and pulled at my hips, but I pulled away, breaking the kiss in the process. She sighed in slight disappointment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to remain debt free here, so just lay back. Let me take care of you for a while longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI kneeled over her upper legs, poured more oil into my hands and, starting at her stomach, rubbed the oil into her skin. I moved up her abs and along her rib cage, careful to not touch her nipples as I ran my hands along the outer edge of her breasts, along the top, and down the center of her chest. I did this a few more times, getting closer and closer to her nipples each time, grazing her areolas on the last pass. Instead of traveling back up her tight frame I rested my hands on her hips and worked my fingers under the straps of her underwear. Liz looked me straight in the eyes, her face flushed from my touch, and raised her hips off the bed allowing me to pull her panties completely off after I rocked back onto my heels and she bent her knees. We kept eye contact the entire time, she stretched her legs back out under mine, and I resumed running my hands along her torso.\n\nThis pass over her breasts I ran my hands up her torso, fingers along her side and stopped at the base of her breasts, then, rotating my hands towards her center, I let her nipples glide under and between each of my fingers, I drew my hands down her frame, rotating my fingers back out to her sides, and did the same motion again, this time slower so her nipples were pressed into her breasts more fully with each of my fingers. Liz closed her eyes and began moaning softly as I continued to touch her. Soon I moved back and stood at the edge of the bed, placed my hands on her knees, and pressed them gently apart, making sure this was okay. I could tell there was part of her that was embarrassed, she turned away from me and closed her eyes as she spread her legs apart.\n\nHairless, it looked like she had just shaved, possibly during her shower just before and she was wet, I could see strings of grool attached to her labia as they spread apart for the first time in the hour or so I\xe2\x80\x99d been massaging her. I lifted one of her legs and kissed her along her foot, down her calf, lowering myself onto the bed as I kissed along her inner thigh. I reached the center and focused on Liz\xe2\x80\x99s breathing, I could tell she wanted my touch but I simply breathed on her vagina and moved to her other leg instead, kissing along the inner thigh and moving up her leg to her calf and foot. Next, I moved in and kissed both of her inner thighs, one after the other, getting closer and closer to the prize.\n\nI leaned my head against the side of her leg and gently licked the outside of slit, tasting her juices for the first time. It tasted like clean pussy, not sweet, but clean. I focused on Liz\xe2\x80\x99s breathing to figure her out as I moved from her left to her right dragging my tongue across her entrance as I did, eliciting a sharp breath. I ran my tongue gently along the other side and sucked this side of her labia into my mouth, running my tongue along it as I did.\n\nI repositioned myself, placing her legs over my shoulders and placing my hands across her stomach, holding her hips in place. I gently licked her, from the bottom to the top, just barely touching her with the tip of my tongue. She moaned loudly and moved one hand to her mouth to keep quiet. I reached up and grabbed her elbow, pulling that hand down and placing it on my head to encourage her to set the pace and be loud if she wanted to and continued to lick. I began circling her breasts with my hands, occasionally pinching her nipples as I applied more pressure with my tongue, exploring her more intently, pressing my tongue as far into her as I could. I could tell this was getting her close already, as I focused on her breathing, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to end so soon. I let up, suddenly becoming gentle again, and I could hear her breath of slight frustration and a slight whimper, begging for release.\n\nI moved one hand to her lower stomach, pulling her stomach up towards her head and gently sucked at her more exposed clit. I heard Liz whisper, \\*\xe2\x80\x9cHoly shit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\\* and knew this was the beginning of the end for her. I kept the rhythm the same for a while but the varied the pressure. Soft, then firm, then soft for a few, then hard for a few. I focused on Liz\xe2\x80\x99s breathing, adapting the rhythm slightly to match her breaths. I moved down slowly and pressed my tongue hard against her opening and heard her let out a heavy breath. She grabbed my head with both hands, rotated her hips up slightly, and pulled me into her. She came hard on my tongue and I buried it inside of her, I could feel her tensing against my tongue several times and she moaned loudly with the same pattern.\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t move for quite a while as her shuddering slowed and her breathing became more normal. Once she was down from what I assume was cloud nine I started to slowly lick her, bottom to top, cleaning her off as she twitched as I moved around her sensitive folds.\n\nI sat up and looked at her, sweat gathered in sections across her body and she started back at me with a somewhat shocked, but very happy smile and said, quite simply, \xe2\x80\x9cWow\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\\---\n\nThis took a lot longer to write than I thought it would, so if you guys want to hear more about our quarantine you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask. I doubt it\xe2\x80\x99ll take much convincing as it was fun to write, but damn does it take me a long time.\n\nThanks for reading!'

###### b"That's the hottest story I've read for ages. So well written too. We definitely need more!"
###### b'At the beginning you called her your cousin and just before the massage you called her your niece...which one is it?'
###### b"A few things\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nFirst, that was fucking incredible.\n\nYou said that the really hot stuff started at the second set of dashes, but all the build up was very hot too.\n\nThere's an r/incest subreddit that would be very interested in reading this if you are so inclined to post it there. The sub is quarantined, just FYI.\n\nYou should also consider heading over to Literotica.com, creating an account, and publishing this in the incest/taboo section. You have a 5-star story on your hands here.\n\nI noticed a few small writing errors here and there along the way, so if you wanted to get some editing assistance before publishing, hit me up. I edit a number of authors' work already and would be happy to help. Totally free, of course.\n\nThis was an absolute pleasure to read. I know how much time and work it took since I'm also a writer.\n\nI really hope you'll continue to share more. I'll definitely be following you to keep an eye out for new posts.\n\nThanks for sharing this."

## My very nerdy, shy friend had the biggest dick I’ve ever seen [FM]
#### b"I laughed so hard writing this.\n\nI went to law school so I\xe2\x80\x99m no stranger to nerdy men. They are my people. I speak their language. They were my favorite people to drunkenly make out with.\n\nOne of my friends was particularly awkward, but eight shades of adorable. He was a late bloomer who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet figured out he was attractive, and could never quite work up the nerve to ask me out. I found out he was a virgin about halfway through 2L year, and assumed it was because he was so shy.\n\nI now have other theories\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n*Btw yall, he went into patent law and married a literal model. I just want to say upfront that this guy ended up ok because this story gets rough.*\n\nHe lived with eight of our classmates in a huge group house just off campus. I went to a party one night at his place and the two of us ended up flirting. Actually, I attempted to flirt with him as he remained mostly oblivious to my advances. I was desperately trying to turn the conversation spicy and he was going off about how his Ivy League alma mater cut him from robotics club or something. It was some serious nerd shit I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really following.\n\n*I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to come across as an ass. I was drunk and kind of bored. Sue me.*\n\nFinally, I kiss this dude. He tenses up, looks at me with absolute terror, and then apologizes. I ask him for what and he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the wrong thing to say, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d I just shrug. Then he adorably puts his drink down, grabs my shoulders, and very awkwardly kisses me back. He was noticeably nervous, but it was really sweet.\n\nHe pulls back, grabs a bottle of wine, and suggests we go to his room to talk. I ask if he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to just get me drunk and alone and this poor dude is mortified and apologizes profusely. Obviously, I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding so I just take his hand and drag him upstairs.\n\nI immediately sit on his bed and he awkwardly paces around the room and tells me about his legos. His. Legos. Then, completely unprompted, he tells me he\xe2\x80\x99s a virgin and I shrug and explain that I already knew that.\n\n*It\xe2\x80\x99s law school. We all know everything about each other.*\n\nI also tell him we\xe2\x80\x99re not about to have sex. I really just want to get a little tipsy and make out with someone. He loves this plan. He explains he\xe2\x80\x99s had a crush on me for a while and I tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought he was really attractive. This is the confidence boost he needs to tear himself away from said legos, tear off his glasses, and come make out with me. He gets on top and we start very lightly dry humping.\n\nSo, that\xe2\x80\x99s when I feel it. He is very hard through his pants and he is\xe2\x80\xa6 large. Large is a damn understatement. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get an accurate size estimate through jeans, but there was no mistaking the abnormally large bulge. He pulls back and apparently sees my shock and gets really nervous, asking me if something is wrong. I just shake my head and we got back to making out.\n\nBut damn it, I have to see it.\n\nI very gently work my hand down his back, around his belt, and finally reach for his crotch. Holy fucking shit. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to calculate how this poor man walks straight. Meanwhile, he thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m just giving him a handjob over his pants and is muttering between kisses how good it feels. In reality, this is more of an exploration mission for the sake of my gender.\n\nI slip my hand in his pants and kind of touch him for all of two seconds until he leans back and says he needs a minute. I am fine with that because I am legitimately still processing the fact that my fingers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even fit around it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs something wrong with you?\xe2\x80\x9d He asks as he reads the confusion on my face.\n\n*How does one explain this to someone who is seemingly oblivious? No one ever sits you down and educates you on how to tell someone their dick is abnormally huge.*\n\nI dive in. \xe2\x80\x9cOk dude, I just have to ask, has anyone ever told you that you have a massive penis?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe turns bright red and can\xe2\x80\x99t look me in the eye. \xe2\x80\x9cSort of.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, a girl told me once it was above average.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m shook this has never come up in conversation. To this day, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if he\xe2\x80\x99s just being shy or if I\xe2\x80\x99m the first person he has this realization with, but he is genuinely taken aback.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you watch porn?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask him.\n\nHe kind of shrugs and gives a small nod.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOk,\xe2\x80\x9d I go on, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever noticed that you have a significantly larger dick than most men in porn\xe2\x80\xa6 Who all have above-average dicks?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*I promise I am not trying to embarrass this poor, shy man, but I am also so fucking shocked I\xe2\x80\x99m being awkward AF. Idk how to respond to this either.*\n\nHe starts laughing and says I might just have a small sample size. I promise him that\xe2\x80\x99s not the issue. At this, we both start giggling and the tension finally breaks.\n\nHe asks if I want to see it and I very enthusiastically say yes. If I'm already in Paris I'm not going to skip the Eiffel Tower. He pulls down his pants without hesitation and lets me just stare for a couple of seconds.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to be impressed or terrified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to write this a million ways and the only word that comes to mind is \xe2\x80\x9cmonstrous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really cannot emphasize this enough, but you have the largest dick I have ever seen. Ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s smiling so big now and looks pretty pleased with himself. He asks if I\xe2\x80\x99d ever want to see what it felt like and I tell him I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s even possible. Like bro, I have deep-throated some large dicks before, but I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure this dude would not even fit halfway down my mouth, much less in other places.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to make some girl very happy one day,\xe2\x80\x9d I tell him. \xe2\x80\x9cPossibly a little sore for a while, but very, very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe keeps trying to kiss me after that but the magic is kind of gone. We make out for a bit, but then I tell him it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late and that I need to head home. I also need to Google if he has some kind of medical condition because I was not aware this could occur naturally.\n\nWhile I did not tell anyone about this encounter, he apparently let it slip to one of his roommates that he did indeed have the biggest dick I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even mind that the rumor spread through our law school like wildfire. This dude fucking slayed the rest of our time in school. He hooked up with more girls than the movie star we graduated with. This dude did not graduate a virgin.\n\nI was invited to his wedding a while back. The bride gave a speech about how he\xe2\x80\x99s full of surprises.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s the real hero of this story. "

###### b'No wonder he had absolutely zero game once you came onto him: the damn kid was suffering from critical blood loss.'
###### b'"If I\'m already in Paris I\'m not going to skip the Eiffel Tower."\n\nYou ma\'am, are a first rate-purveyor of smut. Keep it up!'
###### b'As a man that was a somewhat late bloomer myself (didn\xe2\x80\x99t cash in the ol\xe2\x80\x99 v-card until I was 21) and struggled to realize I was actually pretty above average in attractiveness (I promise this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a humblebrag, just the way I grew up I never felt like it was okay to think of myself as such) I want to give you a big shout out and thank you on behalf of all the late bloomers. You did the proverbial lord\xe2\x80\x99s work right there.'
###### b'You really unleashed that monster \xf0\x9f\x98\x85'
###### b"You're always a good writer, but this line was terrific:  *If I'm already in Paris I'm not going to skip the Eiffel Tower.*"
###### b'Did you not want to play more with his dick?'
###### b'Not even a hand job? Damn.  \n\n\nI bet he still thinks about you and what you did for him, but also that he missed out on doing anything with you.'
###### b'Went to law school. \n\nInvites peoples to sue you.\n\nSeems legit.'
###### b"Heh, this reminds me of a conversation with an ex, where I'm asking why exactly she was so intent on getting back with *me* again when it wasn't exactly like there weren't other interested guys.\n\nReally wasn't expecting her answer."
###### b'Brilliant and beautiful story and written with charm and wit.   Thank you for sharing it.'
###### b'Omggg \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d how big was he do you reckon?'
###### b"Nah, you're the real hero of this story. You really got him out of his shell and it showed ;)"
###### b'As a very oblivious guy (not a lawyer, just a public policy graduate) who had someone grab me and just say \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the fuck, why is it so big?\xe2\x80\x9d I love this story \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
###### b"Tbh most of the nerdy dudes I've slept with are well endowed."
###### b"I swear, It's always the guys that you least expect that have the largest cocks"

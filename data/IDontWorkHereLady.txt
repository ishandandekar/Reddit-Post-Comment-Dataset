##### b'As I am enjoying this I just finished my salad, with a heavy helping of "Lord of the Ring" salsa sauce on it. I will not regret it later, have gotten to quit like the taste.\n\nWas at the supermarket one afternoon when the samples were out with a sales rep, and I took a small cracker, piled on the salsa and ate it. she was amazed, as she found it incredibly hot, while I was just saying it was nice and tangy. Around 20 seconds later my sinuses were totally clear.'

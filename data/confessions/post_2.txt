## Why I am Aunt Susan the Karma Farming Facebook Fiend
#### b'My Reddit username is Coolgirlonthetrain.  I am not really \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d but I commute daily on a train.  So it\xe2\x80\x99s partially correct.  I am an English woman.  Living in England.  About 2 years ago the fate that is called life landed an American guy in my local pub.  My first impression was that he was different and a little odd.  I was drawn to this oddness.  It was cool and exciting and it brings out my personality and inner quirks.  About a year ago we have become the best of friends.  It\xe2\x80\x99s platonic and it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a friendship like no other.    Well, of course being a typically reserved English woman I had never heard of Reddit.  The guy, who shall be known as Mr X obviously is a hardcore Redditer and has an established account.   He told me about Reddit suggesting I set up an account and bet that I could never achieve the same amount of Karma as him.    I think it was more the smug grin on his face as he was looking down at me that had the greatest impact and made me more so determined.  What I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he realised is that I am incredibly competitive with the determination and heart of a Lion. The prize if I did would be a trip to Canada. I have never been West so for me this would be incredible.  This was three weeks ago.    Over the last three weeks I have frantically posted all sorts of stuff in an eager attempt to work out what works.   I have been called every name under the sun \xe2\x80\x9cKarma Whore\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cKarma Farmer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAunt Susan\xe2\x80\x9d and to colloquially go back to Facebook.  I have even been requested to stay on my side of the \xe2\x80\x9cPond\xe2\x80\x9d.   This is my confession.   This is why I have been behaving like Aunt Susan the Karma Farming Facebook fiend.   I apologise and if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested I will of course keep you posted.  Confessions of the not so cool girl on the train.'

###### b'40k karma in three weeks? Damn\n\nEdit: another 40k in one day? Keep being a karma whore, lmao'
###### b"What's your karma target?"
###### b'All the best in your karma whoring, take an upvote on me and enjoy your trip to Cananda! :D'
###### b'I love this. I had no clue you could become a karma whore, congrats on making the title. '
###### b"The Toronto area. Burlington, to be specific. Sometime in March.\n\nCongratulations, u/coolgirlonthetrain. I underestimated you and I shouldn't have. I teased you for posting safe, colorful, 'Aunt Susan' type memes that were so saccharine they could give people a cavity just looking at them. I thought there would be no way you could catch up to my 65k karma. I assumed the cynical jack-asses of reddit would chew you up and spit you out but I was wrong. You have been dedicated, persistent, and come through with the goods. Everyone loves you. r/funny loves you. r/mildlyinteresting loves you. r/pics loves you. r/confessions loves you. Even my group of merry knuckleheads at r/me_irl loves you.\n\nI am very proud of you and honored to be called a friend of yours.\n\nI concede. Let's take off to the Great White North.\n\n-Love, Respect, Admiration,\n\nAndy, Mr. X, u/vigilandy1"

###### b'UPDATE FROM AUNT SUSAN....... Well I did it!!!!!!  Thanks to the help of you lovely people I managed to not only match Mr X\xe2\x80\x99s karma but exceed this by thousands!   I am incredibly happy.      Thank you for this!!!   I shall now refrain from bombarding your newsfeeds with reposts!  I have seen Mr X briefly today and he has acknowledged and accepted his loss.   I know that some of you have asked some questions so without forever being Aunt Susan the Karma Farmer I shall try and update you briefly.   (1) I will of course keep you posted if I do travel to Canada and I promise a victory photo (2) Mr X and I are both single but friends only (3) I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr X fancies me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would make some declaration of undeniable love.  There won\xe2\x80\x99t be fireworks  (4) Mr X is my best friend and even though he has stood me up this evening and now fallen asleep I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him any other way and I would never not want him in my life.   No matter what barriers arise, I could never not want him as my best friend.  Thanks again for all of the support.   Confessions of the not so cool girl on the train x '

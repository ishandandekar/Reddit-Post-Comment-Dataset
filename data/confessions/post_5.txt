## I quit crystal meth on March 1st. Today somebody left some on my coffee table and I threw it out. Feeling like I've proven I'm free
#### b'Wow, this blew up. Thank you for all your support. This is the first time I checked Reddit after my post. Thank you for the silver and gold and for all the encouragement!'

###### b'Dude please, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take this as a negative or me shitting in your achievement. \n\nFirst of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s fucking awesome.  Had a bunch of friends addicted to opiates and as much as I tried to help, nothing worked. Some are dead/in jail/or are just a fucking mess still (I\xe2\x80\x99m in my 40\xe2\x80\x99s as are they).  \n\nDude not only did you quit but you were able to toss what was lying around. I feel that would of been the first relapse for most people.  Truly shows your strength and character and I genuinely wish you nothing but the best moving forward. \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know your story but I found it concerning that a month or so after you quit someone left shit in your house. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you heard this a ton of times and I\xe2\x80\x99m really not trying to bring you down at all, but get the fuck away from those people.   Maybe try support groups or something similar to meet people in similar situations who understand what\xe2\x80\x99s needed to stay clean.  \n\nYou should be proud of yourself, hell I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all proud of ya. Stay strong brother and if you need to chat or something feel free to pm me whenever. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xe2\x9c\x8c\xef\xb8\x8f\n\nEdit: toward to forward'
###### b'Congrats! And just a friendly suggestion maybe dont hang around folks who will leave meth on your coffee table'
###### b'congrats to a new beginning.'
###### b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t let that piece of shit back in your house, much less your life. You got this and keep your head up. Congrats.'
###### b'Not only does OP karma farm constantly on this sub for baity-drug related posts to get sympathy points over the internet, this is a LITERAL quote from OP that he\'s deleted...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"[I was using crystal meth the past couple months and quit on my birthday a few days ago. I have been using cocaine socially since then and consider coke a "light" drug now and don\'t plan on quitting...](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ah6gc8/i_was_using_crystal_meth_the_past_couple_months/) "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConfession: You\'re a huge douche.'

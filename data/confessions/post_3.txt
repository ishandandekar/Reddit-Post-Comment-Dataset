## I broke up with my boyfriend because he yelled at me.
#### b'I\'m a 29 year old woman.\n\nHe and I dated for about eight months. Our relationship was fine. We did things together, we had fun. There weren\'t any obvious red flags, but I always got this feeling that he didn\'t value me much. At times he seemed a bit cold and acted like he was annoyed with me for no apparent reason.  \n\n\nIt all came to a head when, three days ago when we were hanging out at my place, he asked me to hand him the TV remote. I was sitting right next to him on the couch and was working on my laptop. I reached for the remote without looking and accidentally handed him my phone instead.  \n\n\nI though it was funny after I realized what I had done. I laughed as I handed him the actual remote. He had that same annoyed look on his face. He began yelling at me and called me "a stupid bitch". \n\nI was stunned. I have NEVER raised my voice at him, or disrespected him in any way. I did not deserve to be treated this way. I told him our relationship was over and asked him to leave. He told me to calm down and stop overreacting. \n\nI simply walked to the front door opened it wide and told him to get out, and never come back. He walked out telling me I was being dramatic. \n\nThe very next day I returned the presents he had given me. They meant nothing to me now.\n\nMy friends are telling me that I DID overreact and I shouldn\'t just end a relationship because he yelled at me once,  and have asked me to patch things up. His friends too began harassing me on social media.  I blocked them all (HIS friends, not mine). \n\nI\'m not going to reach out to him to try to "work things out" as some people have suggested. Because I know that I do not deserve this treatment. I\'ve always treated him with respect and I deserve that in return. \n\nI just needed to tell somebody. Thank you for reading.'

###### b"Hang on... He shouted and swore at you for absent mindedly handing him a phone over a remote, but it's YOU who is overreacting?\n\nAnd why are your friends so keen for you to go out with him anyway?  How does he benefit them?"
###### b"\n>My friends are telling me that I DID overreact and I shouldn't just end a relationship because **he yelled at me once**\n\nSomehow I find this even more vexing"
###### b'I absolutely love your boundaries and how you see things clearly. It was definitely the right decision. \n\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to apologise but forced you to work things out with him and accused you of being dramatic. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need that kind of energy in your life.'
###### b"I chose to stay with a boyfriend who yelled at me because he was mad I had walked and gotten him a coffee and woke him up 5 minutes early to give it to him. I married that dude, and got yelled at for 20 years.   \n\n\nNow I leave people who yell at me over nothing.  \n\n\nYou are smart. You'll do better than I did. Good luck!"
###### b"I just wanted to say that I'm really impressed by your evident self- worth and independence. \nI legit love reading about instances where people know their value and refuse to accept anything less!"
###### b'Damn that escalated quickly. No one should call you a bitch over something so insignificant that\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. Imagine if you did something worse damn.   My wife left me because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her where the remote was. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know lol.'
###### b'You\xe2\x80\x99re not overreacting. Seems like you dodged a bullet to me.'
###### b'Not going to lie, I can be a pain in the ass. My husband has never treated me badly, and he\xe2\x80\x99s never called me names. You 100% did the right thing, you teach people how to treat you, if you\xe2\x80\x99d let him stay it\xe2\x80\x99s just telling him that he\xe2\x80\x99s right to treat you that way. I wish more people had the good sense to end a crappy relationship early.'
###### b"That's nuts"
###### b'HELL. YES.\n\nFinally a confession about an ex that I fully stand behind lmao.\n\nYou are an inspiration. Take no shit. Fuck yes dude.\n\nYou did the absolutely right thing! Didn\'t play it off and put yourself through possibly endless cycles of breaking up and getting back together. Straight to the point. You KNOW your worth.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter if you talk to him\nHe\'ll cry like a bitch to be with someone at your maturity level.\nLeave him be. Block him. (You already blocked his friends which was my next service lmao)\n\nBUT!\n\nGIRL, seriously. Talk with your friends in depth. If they don\'t stand behind you, I would SERIOUSLY question their motives behind the "advice" they gave you to stick it out with him.\n\nDon\'t just think about him, look at your "friends". Also, they might be traumatized/conditioned to think this is okay, but set an example. Seriously.\n\nAs an adult you should be expected to act like an adult, not like your bf who threw a hissy fit over a remote.\n\nBe an example.\nYou are an inspiration and #goals.\nSending love and good vibes.\nDM is always open if you want to talk but yeah everything above still stands 100%'
###### b"More often than not, in my experience, that is a sign of someone's true nature. Being so quick to anger and insults is probably something he's been surpressing and he finally let it out. In my limited knowledge of him, it sounds like things had the potential to get much worse, possibly on a regular basis. You stood up for yourself and didn't let him treat you like that, I think you made the right choice OP. Excellent example of self compassion and proper boundaries."
###### b'Yeah walk away from that. Today you\'re a "stupid bitch" for a kinda funny miss pass. Tomorrow you\'re in the hospital with a feeding tube cause he\'s an abusive cunt. Signed some guy'
###### b"For me it's not the fact that he reacted by yelling at you. I could understand some temporary sudden burst of bad temper. But insulting you with no reason whatsoever... that's a huge red flag, absolutely unacceptable.\n\nYou made the correct decision."
###### b"Dunno, man.  If I pulled that kinda thing on my gf she'd have kicked me into he balls and dumped me. That kinda talk is a mega ultra huge red flag.  Like, abusers are always sweet as pie in the beginning, and then stuff like that happens and it escalates from there cuz they know they can get away with it."
###### b"Good for you. You deserve the peace of not being yelled at.\n\n\nIt sounds like you have friends that get yelled at, and that makes me sad for them.\n\n\nYou don't owe anybody a second chance to mistreat you."

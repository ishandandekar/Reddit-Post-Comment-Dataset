## I masturbate to pictures of Ben Shapiro almost every day just because I know he would hate the idea of a male wanking to him
#### b"it's actually really difficult because I don't find him sexually attractive in any way and especially just his headshots but I have done it every day for about 2 years because I found it funny at first but now I'm so used to it that it makes me feel incomplete if I don't do it every day."

###### b'well I hope he checks his reddit regulary'
###### b'Thought I was on /r/copypasta'
###### b"do you start to get a boner now when you see him like pavlov's dogs?"
###### b"*Let's say you've been a bad boy. Let's say, hypothetically, you've been a naughty boy even. Ok, and if you were a naughty boy, you would be my dirty little slut right? Then hypothetically speaking, you would be my little cumslut. Now, let's say you're also daddy's boy.*\n\n*Now that we have established that you are both a bad boy and daddy's boy, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that you deserve a spanking. Am I not correct? A bad boy deserves a spanking, and as I am daddy, you are my boy, so I am the one who must provide punishment.*"
###### b'Enough reddit for me today'

###### b'Dude... I... this is something'
###### b"The most 'reddit' thing I've ever heard"
###### b"If there's no video evidence it never happened\n\xf0\x9f\x91\x80\n\nEDIT: Wow my most liked comment of all time is just me being a pervert \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9"
###### b'Uhhh... Yeah, you showed him! Erm...'
###### b'This is the dumbest thing I have ever read.'
###### b"Pretty sure it's a troll post but I laughed anyway."
###### b"Jesus christ it sounds like you need a therapist. Not saying this because I am a Shapiro fan or something but holy shit man that is fucking creepy. He is a stranger that does not know or give 2 shits about who you are but you are going to dedicate what are probably the most joyis moments of your day and little life to aggressively jacking off to someone who has upset you?? I guess thankfully you didn't just pick some random undeserving person out of the yearbook, but get some help man that is the creepiest most stalker like behavior I have ever heard someone admitt and you are proud of it.... get help or a life."
###### b'Man I just logged in and have to log out now. Wtf'

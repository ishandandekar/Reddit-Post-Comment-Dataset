## I ghosted my longterm BF
#### b'Got into an argument which lead him to say \xe2\x80\x9cI could care less about you. If you died tomorrow, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to your funeral\xe2\x80\x9d. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything back, just never spoke to him again. He\xe2\x80\x99s tried to contact me several times since, but I want those to be the last words he\xe2\x80\x99s ever said to me. Bitchass bitch'

###### b'I ghosted a long term boyfriend before (for many reasons but) because every time we would argue he\xe2\x80\x99d say \xe2\x80\x9cfine I\xe2\x80\x99m breaking up with you\xe2\x80\x9d. So one time he said it, I told him to get the fuck out of my house and blocked his number. Best decision I ever made. Good for you for sticking up for yourself! '
###### b'I had to do the same with my ex girlfriend. We where "working on things" but her neurosis shined through her attempt at being a better woman to me after a long year of emotional and physical abuse. The last thing she will have ever said to me is "I\'m pregnant" in an email with a fake ultrasound pulled from Google. Fuck her. '
###### b'Finally, the ghosting technique being used appropriately.\n\nPlenty of other mates out there. Keep strong. '
###### b'When people tell you who they are, believe them. \n\nEdit: I didn\'t get the quote exactly right. I was thinking of the Maya Angelou quote "When Someone Shows You Who They Are, Believe Them". Wasn\'t expecting this many upvotes. Glad others find meaning in it too. Yeah, it\'s a simple, FB worthy meme phrase - but it resonates really deeply with me. I was married, and madly in love with someone who treated me horribly for many years, and he told me and showed me who he was - but I chose to believe his lies instead. \n\nSince the divorce, and the horrors of uncovering his double life that followed that, my new mantra is "trust that he sucks". That\'s a keeper. Still working on fixing my picker. Maybe someday I\'ll find someone who isn\'t an emotionally and mentally abusive narcissist, and give it another go, but for now, I\'m happy with my kids dogs, cats, and myself. '
###### b'I\'d ghost someone too if they said "could care less" instead of "couldn\'t care less." You\'ll find someone one day who knows the difference and you\'ll be much better off.'
###### b"Stuff like that can't be unsaid. I don't blame you one bit!"
###### b'Bitch ass bitch is going to be my most used word today. Thank you for being you. '
###### b'\xe2\x80\x9cBitchass Bitch\xe2\x80\x9dhahaha I love it. '
###### b'Sometimes people just need to understand that words have consequences. '
###### b'Appropriate action'
###### b'I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even say that to the exes/former friends I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand. You did the right thing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t owe him anything after that. Couples argue but he crossed about a million lines saying something that nasty. Good riddance. '
###### b'Damn. I truly hope he lives with those words forever. \n\nGood for you, and i hope you\xe2\x80\x99re okay. '
###### b"I'd cut a motherfucker that said something like that out of my life, too. Fuck that. "
###### b'Honestly I was completely against ever ghosting anyone in a relationship. No exceptions. \n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s just say I\xe2\x80\x99ve found an exception here. I completely respect and encourage this decision. \n\nSure he can apologize all he wants and it might be heartfelt and he might mean it, but he just professed his feelings pretty clearly to you here...\n\nThat said he is human. But still fuck him. \n\n\n**Edited** for clarity'
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve also ghosted a long term BF. It was on again, off again and he kept cheating on me and then breaking up with me when he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d found something better. A week or so later it was all, \xe2\x80\x9chey baby, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re the only one\xe2\x80\x9d type of bullshit. One day I was just done. Changed my phone number, blocked his email address. He tried getting out mutual friends to reach out on his behalf. Ghosted them, too. Sweet freedom was worth it.'

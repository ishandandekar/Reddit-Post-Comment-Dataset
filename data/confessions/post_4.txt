## I made over 16 calls today trying to find mental health services in my area. More specifically a psychologist that could help. In the end I just gave up. No wonder America has a mental health crisis. Nobody answers the damn phone when people try to seek help.

###### b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new advice, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in this. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad commentary on the state of mental healthcare when it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find a provider, and when you do, the first appointment you can get is 3 months away. I ended up going to my general practitioner, who prescribed antianxiety meds and a mild antidepressant until I could be seen by a therapist. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would have done if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. Best of luck to you, and please don\xe2\x80\x99t give up! If nothing else, try to get in to see your regular doctor and let them know you need help. Sometimes you just have to keep yelling until someone listens.'
###### b'Warm lines\n(Non crisis peer support)\n\xe2\x80\x9c\nIndiana 1-800-933-5397\n8am-5pm m-f\nKentucky 1-859-252-0058\n5p-9p m-f\nOhio 1-513-931-9276\n24/7\nNew York City \n1-888-692-9355\n24/7\nUtah\n801-587-1055\n\n- [ ]  \nTry a warm line! Keeps me out of the hospital. I wish you well.'
###### b'If anyone needs someone to talk to. I may not be a psychiatrist but I do work as a combat medic and I\xe2\x80\x99m more than willing to listen and talk and help you find your way. Dm for a number I will always answer. \n\nEdit: My lord thank you kind strangers for the gold and sliver!

###### b"If you have a normal physician/doctor/hospital that you go to for normal check ups, you can mention that you'd like to be connected to a mental health professional and they can give you direct referrals and contacts to try. "
###### b'No joke I called the suicide hotline and had the messenger going at the same time. An hour later was still on hold. Would also take me weeks to get into see my shrink. It sucks. When people need help it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult. '
###### b'2 years ago I had a damn near impossible time trying to check myself in during a manic episode. Staff during my 72 hours was shit too. Fuck the mental health system.'
###### b'Just one possible explanation - as a mental health practitioner, it\xe2\x80\x99s only me in the office and am often in session when people call. Leave messages when and where you can- people are out there to help but we don\xe2\x80\x99t always have the staff to field all the need in the most timely manner. Hope you find someone great to work with! '
###### b'Thanks everyone for trying to help me. '
###### b'Word. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but don\xe2\x80\x99t give it! I am having the same issue with trying to find help with my son. '
###### b'Or maybe just no money but an non judgement ear to speak to and vent to if need be.'
###### b'You are right. I have been a volunteer on a crisis line for victims of domestic violence for about 12 years. In that time, I feel my work is closer to that of a mental health professional than a trained intervention councilor. The resources for mental health are pathetic.'
###### b'I actually had the same problem.  I called multiple doctors supposedly covered by my insurance and got no reply. Then I decided to go the out of pocket way which I cant really afford but I was desperate and was still unsuccessful.  I gave up.'
###### b'Back in the 80\xe2\x80\x99s and 90\xe2\x80\x99s.  When there was more mental institutions. There used to be a long term place for people with mental issues. Then some politician decided that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right and the majority of the hospitals were closed. After they were closed the half way house boom occured, and they barely provide any care, and just take money. Its why we have so many prople with mental illness roaming the streets. Anyone born before 2000 can remember this (one who flew over the cukoos nest movie reference these institution) Most people with psych issues are usually put on a hold for 48-72 hours and released.  Its a joke. Mental services are horribly managed and needs more oversight. Especially with more and more people with mental illness today. Some still exist but thats for the most severe patients.  And by severe i mean eating your shit cuz the talking demon shoe from the 5th universe told me to. \n\nI would also like to add that there were issues with the old institutions and its why they were closed. However look at the alternative we have now.  '
###### b'Psychologytoday.com has a way to find providers in your area that take insurance to see a therapist. \n\nIf you are in crisis now, ER is always an option. They can see you for a few days and refer out to inpatient/out patient programs. \n\nYou can also walk into any crisis center near you and they\xe2\x80\x99ll help. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a step down from ER. Short stays, typically voluntary. \n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling safe, but not safe enough to wait 3 months to see your pcp for a referral, call and ask for a sick visit. If you try to schedule a regular office visit, it will be a decent amount of time before you get in. All doctors offices have spots reserved daily for emergency/sick visits. Tell them you are sick and need a doctor now. \n\nYour PCP can refer you to a therapist, inpatient program, a partial program (which is like in patient but it\xe2\x80\x99s 9-5 for a week and you go home after), and other behavioral health services. \n\nIf none of that works, for the love of god get yourself to a peer center/recovery learning center. I can not say enough good things about these places. They\xe2\x80\x99re free, don\xe2\x80\x99t take any insurance you just walk in. You can participate as much or as little as you want, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the most supportive and accepting environment you\xe2\x80\x99ll find. There\xe2\x80\x99s a significant amount of research that shows these programs trump medication and therapy combined. You have to have overcome some major mental health issue to even work at one. They\xe2\x80\x99re incredible. It\xe2\x80\x99s scary to go to a new place, but by god are they so safe, supportive, and non judgmental. \n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong about the system. It is fucked in ways, but a lot of it is knowing where to look and how to get access to services. \n\nIf ya need more feel free to pm me. '
###### b'I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s sad at that some people don\xe2\x80\x99t take mental health as seriously as it needs to be taken'

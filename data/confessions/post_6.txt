## I used to pay my middle school bully not to bully me then I found out he actually needed the money
#### b"He made my life a living hell. He would turn all the boys in class against me and bully me about my eyebrows. One time he begged me to buy him pizza and said he promises not to bully me all week if i do. So I bought him a box of pizza and he fulfilled his promise. I loved the idea. I began to do it on a regular basis. I started asking him every Friday what he wants next week so that the bullying doesn't happen again. He asked for 2 bags of hot fries (a potato chip flavor here in the US) and another time he wanted some milk from the cafeteria. And once he asked for colored pencils for art class. \n\nMy school had a uniform dress code. It was $25 per shirt and the pants were $15, if I remember correctly. He showed up the first day of 8th grade in regular clothes, a tee and jeans. So he got sent to the main office to wait for his parents. My aunt was there because she used to drop off my lunch and hand me money to buy food after school. She saw him upset and asked what's wrong and he starts crying lightly. His parents wouldn't come because they couldn't afford the uniform and decided it would be best to avoid the situation. After my aunt hands me my lunch, she buys him a uniform hoodie, a couple of tees, and a long sleeve. He said he had pants at home and he was hesitant to accept but eventually took them and thanked her. \n\nNow (13 years later) he runs a nonprofit that has something to do with kids receiving books. I think it's sweet and I forgive him for being a bully because he didn't grow up to be an a-hole like most bullies. \n \n\nEdit: Thank you for all the nice comments!! There's too many to keep up with and reply to, which is sweet!"

###### b"Thank you for granting the forgiveness to your bully that I cannot seem to give to mine. I know it's toxic to hold the grudge I do, but I guess that some things that I let go of are destined to be covered in claw marks. "
###### b'So many kids who bully others do so because they are so damaged and hurt in some way. It is absolutely heartbreaking as a teacher to see from all sides. '
###### b'This is both sad AND uplifting.'

###### b'Thankyou for your story. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to have read it. I see now as well, the bullies I had in highschool were just children in pain with no other way to take control of their lives. '
###### b'So have you done something about them eyebrows yet, OP?'
###### b'I mean this dont belong in r/confessions... its too wholesome'

###### b'In a way, you guys saved a good person from becoming a lost cause. He had potential for good and first, you made him see that being bad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay, and your aunt showed him the value of being good. Thank you for saving the society one more in-and-out-of-the-system criminal and contributing to the creation of a charitable, good individual!'
###### b'Bc of you and your aunt his heart grew three sizes that day.:)'
###### b"This is just sad because there is plenty of kids like this, part of them figures if everyone is afraid of me, no one will notice that I'm wearing the same shirt for a week and no one will comment on why I carry the same bag every year.\n\nThis doesn't excuse their behavior because bullying will only create more bullies.\n\nThat's why I am an advocate for free education and health care, with complete free education where the kid only has to show up, it takes the pressure off so many kids, no worries about uniform, supplies, money for trips ...etc. Sorry I am aspiring to be a pediatrician and I have seen and heard of so many stories of similar kids like this."
###### b'In middle school I paid a bully to beat up my bully. It worked and he made my bully apologize to me. '
###### b"Wow, this is really just great. I really wasn't sure where this story was going and then it went awesome."

## I bought 40000 Reddit coins
#### b'Cause I like giving plat and gold to strangers on the internet. They\xe2\x80\x99re always very thankful and it makes me a bit happy because I\xe2\x80\x99m asocial as fuck irl and I could never brighten someone\xe2\x80\x99s day like I can on here'

###### b'What do you do for a living if I may ask??? Y\xe2\x80\x99all hiring?!? Lol '
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"If what you're saying is true that's very nice of you to do"
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do something like this but I\xe2\x80\x99m too broke lol. Guess I can still help people by giving nice comments for free. The internet needs less trashy people and more people like OP\n\nEdit:thank you for the silver, gold and platinum :)'
###### b'same except I\xe2\x80\x98m too poor to spend my money on stuff like that lol'
###### b'Nice try reddit marketing team'
###### b'Please don\xe2\x80\x99t give me a gold like you have done to so many others, just here to say I like your style :)'
###### b'I wish someone gave you gold for this (I can\xe2\x80\x99t as I\xe2\x80\x99m broke right now). Also, please don\xe2\x80\x99t give me gold for commenting, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be your friend over the internet if you want one. '
###### b'Ok, what....this blew me away. How do you buy Reddit coins? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that it\xe2\x80\x99s regular Redditors giving out gold'
###### b'Been waiting for ages to use my 100 coins and I think you deserve some silver for this. It\xe2\x80\x99s only an online status thing but it normally means a lot to people (can make someone\xe2\x80\x99s day etc) so you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a great thing OP, you\xe2\x80\x99re awesome.  \n\nDo not gild me please, I need to spend less time here not to be incentivised  \n\nEdit: fucking wise guy, giving me silver. Take it back'

## Today, my next door pregnant neighbor knocked on my door.
#### b'Around 7 pm today, I heard some knocking on my door. I opened it and it was my next door pregnant neighbor (she was, I think, in her 7th or 8th month). She was holding a small plate in her hand. In a very shy voice, she asked me if I can give her some of what ever I was cooking because she liked the smell. I think pregnant women sometimes have strong cravings and they can not resist it.\n\n Anyway, She was shy and apologized a lot for her request since we don\xe2\x80\x99t know each other. I laughed and told her it is ok :). I was cooking a traditional meal from my country and the recipe has olive oil, garlic, jalape\xc3\xb1os and some spices. I think the smell was nice. I gave her some of my dinner then she left.\n\nI Watched her walking home like a cute little penguin who\xe2\x80\x99s happy with her successful little hunting \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 I felt really happy too for some reason.

###### b"My mom said in Iranian villages it's a custom that if a pregnant woman smells something cooking down the street and craves it, she knocks on the door and the people offer her some of the food :)"
###### b'This is so cute'
###### b'This is precious! You should offer to host them for a dinner party or something - make friends with your neighbours. :) '
###### b'Soooo, give us the recipe!'
###### b'It can be completely overwhelming when you get those pregnancy cravings. Nothing in that moment is as important as what is needed.  It was very sweet of you to share.'
###### b'I have to confess I went through your post history and have to say you are the sweetest human being! You are doing a fantastic job learning English and I really hope you got that hug you needed so badly when times were tough. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever change who you are. You\xe2\x80\x99re amazing! '
###### b"The sense of smell is heightened during pregnancy, along with the food cravings, she just couldn't resist! That's a sweet story, nice of you to share."
###### b"Hold up! Why isn't anyone asking about which country has Jalepeno poppers in their repertoire of traditional food? Where are your from, OP? I'm interested!"
###### b'Im crying because this is wholesome and so adorable. \n\nPenguin!!!'
###### b'How is this a confession?'

###### b"You're a rock star! \n\nFYI, a meal to quickly heat up after the baby is born is SUCH a wonderful gift. \n\nI'm not pregnant, but my neighbours' cooking smells sooooooo good (they're from Mauritius), maybe I should try this."
###### b'How is this a confession? '
###### b"I'm 7 months pregnant and this made my pregnancy hormones go a little crazy. I smell food being cooked around me constantly and I can honestly say I've been tempted before lol. Last week I almost went and asked a guy BBQing next door what his recipe was.. Totally sbould have looking back."
###### b"She will be back for more. Then, next thing you know and you are fathering that child. Then you are paying for child's college. Then all of a sudden, you are a grandparent. All because of some jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers. "

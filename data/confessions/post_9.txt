## I quit Facebook so I would stop wasting time staring at my phone. I now spend more time on Reddit then I ever have on Facebook.
#### b''

###### b'same. But at least I dont get distracted or annoyed by people I vaguely know and reminded of all the things Im missing out on.'
###### b'Did I write this?'
###### b'I mostly browse Reddit on my phone now and it says I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent 9 hours here in the past 7 days. Facebook doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even show up once. \n\nFacebook kinda stopped being a thing for me and most of my friends years ago when it stopped being a fun and somewhat closed off digital version of your extended \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d and instead became a link/article aggregator, except with zero organization or quality control. It feels too \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d now and my feed is nothing but shared articles about things I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for rather than status updates and tagged pics from my friends like it used to be. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel personalized and social anymore. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to delete mine, but I rarely use it or update it whereas I was a heavy user before.\n\nReddit can be a waste of time, but you probably  passively learn a lot of things and it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot less negative than other sites if you manage your subs. '
###### b"When I first downloaded Reddit on my phone, I figured maybe I'd get some good memes and some cool stories to read on askreddit and whatnot (I used to read them via college humor on facebook). I had no idea that I would literally spend hours just reading through COMMENTS on some thread to the point where I actually forget what the fucking post even was. 10/10"
###### b'Spending time on Reddit has contributed to improving my life. In comparison, spending time on FB is like injecting flesh eating bacteria into my brain.\nReddit can generate the same rot as FB, so you have to treat it like a tool. The key, I think, is to avoid validation seeking behavior. If your aim is to discover the truth about your beliefs, more is gained from the tool.'
###### b'I am slowly coming off of Facebook for Reddit. Reddit is so much better. '
###### b'Honestly it\xe2\x80\x99s much better. Actually learn things on Reddit although it can still suck up time but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely better than fb.'
###### b'My boyfriend got me into Reddit and it has taken over my life. So many upvotes on floofy cats.'
###### b'I have 3 friends on Facebook. One is my mom and the other 2 are my own alt accounts. \xf0\x9f\x98\x9e'
###### b'But on Reddit I feel like I learn new things rather than being on FB looking at pointless copypasta of videos and how much "fun" my friends are having today.  I want to scroll through social media without feeling guilty that I wanted to take the day off and chill on my couch. '
###### b'Me, is that you?'
###### b"Am I the only one thinking about deleting Reddit, or at least getting into checking maybe once a week?\n\nI saw the irony that I was thinking of deleting Facebook (which I don't use) like Reddit isn't doing the same/similar things."
###### b'same here, it really is a better time waster and here you might actually learn something.'
###### b'Me tooooo'
###### b'I see all the memes on Reddit before I do on Facebook '

## I hired an escort for my brother with downs syndrome last month. I don't regret it and he still smiles about it.
#### b'I\'m 30 and my little brother is 24. He\'s honestly the best brother I could have asked for. I still remember the day he was born and holding my newborn baby brother when I was a kid. As we grew up I always knew he was different but he\'s my brother and I love him and I wouldn\'t change him. He\'s honestly one of my best friends and having a brother with downs syndrome, especially one like him has made me a better person. \n\nLast month my parents went out of town for a few days and they asked if I\'d stay with my brother and take care of the house. While he might have downs syndrome he\'s not entirely helpless he just can\'t really be on his own like that. So of course I agreed and brought my PS5 over and some games, snacks and beers, I called out of work for a few days and figured we\'d have some fun just like when we were kids.\n\nWe were having a great time and were talking the first day while taking turns playing Elden Ring and my bro started the game and got to the part where the guy calls you "maidenless" and I said something like "Ooooo he called you maidenless bro...daaaaaaamn." and my brother got super sad looking and I asked him what was wrong and he said, "I am maidenless. I\'ll never have a girlfriend." So we talked about that for a bit and he was actually feeling super depressed because he\'s never had a girlfriend and didn\'t think he ever would.  We kind of talked it out and he was really sad and I decided fuck it we can find him a girl. \n\nI called a couple people I knew who were into that sort of thing to see if they knew anyone. Well one of my buddies had a number of this girl so I gave her a call. She was actually super sweet and understanding about the situation and she said she\'d be glad to show my brother a good time for her usual rate. She had a cousin with downs so she was very sympathetic.\n\nI told my brother I\'d pay a girl to come over and show him some fun on the condition that our parents will die without knowing I hired a prostitute to come to their house. He agreed.\n\nSo I made plans for her to come over, got my brother shaved and showered for his date. She showed up dressed up super nice she was also super hot. I\'m no chef but I had picked up some food from Olive Garden for them. She was a genuinely nice person and was really good with him and I just left them to do their thing while I played the playstation in the livingroom. Eventually they passed by going upstairs to his room. I put my headphones on and kept playing. \n\nEventually they came back down and both had big smiles on their faces. She hung out with us a bit then it was time for her to go. I handed her the cash plus some extra as a bonus. She said my brother was a sweetheart and that I was a good brother to do something like that for him and that she had a good time. She handed me half the cash back.\n\nEventually my parents came back and thankfully are none the wiser as my mother especially would probably kill me. My brother is super appreciative and said it was the most fun he\'d ever had. I have no regrets.'

###### b"I took my brother with downs to a strip joint for his birthday. Dropped 500 bucks on him for lap dances. The girls were super kind to him.\n\nHe still talks about it, and this was about 15 years ago.  \n\n\n\\*Edit\\*   \n\n\nFor those making comments, I'm taking him again on his 50th birthday which is in August."
###### b'Epic big bro shit there. Not gonna hire you to babysit for me but your a champ'
###### b'Salute!\n\nBig brothers, its what we do for our siblings. True Love right here boooooy'
###### b'You are a good man. Bro, I have mad respect for you and for that young lady who was kind\nto your brother\xe2\x80\xa6 and I have mad respect for your brother for keeping the secret and for being enough of a gentleman that the young lady walked away feeling appreciated. Well done, dude.'
###### b'This was surprisingly wholesome.'
###### b'Damn this makes me so happy. I have a son with special needs & unfortunately, his needs are severe to the point where this isn\'t an option for him. But I\'m in parents groups for parents of disabled children & this is a popular subject. A lot of parents of "higher functioning" disabled adults are aware of their needs & feelings of loneliness, but have no idea what to do about it. You & your brother are so lucky to have each other.'
###### b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a brother right there. And props to the girl too'
###### b'You had me until "she gave me half the money back."'
###### b"I 'half' believed it until this part:   \n\n\n>She handed me half the cash back."
###### b'"she handed back half the cash"\n\nYeah imma call bullshit only bc of that statement.'
###### b'This is such a weird concept to write a fake story about'
###### b'Fuck yeah, should do it once a year for him'
###### b'>She handed me half the cash back.\n\nComplete horse shit. Fake story. Anyone who believes this woman who has sex with disabled people for money is giving half the money back is a fucking moron.'
###### b'[your mother sitting on the toilet scrolling reddit]\n\n#KEVIN!'
###### b'"She handed me half the cash back" <---- the least plausible of all the implausibles in this Penthouse Letter.'

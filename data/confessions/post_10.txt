## I secretly put money in my pants pockets so my husband will do the laundry
#### b'I put $5 to $10 a week in my clothes. He thinks he is getting one over on me because we both have a weekly budget. He doesn\'t know that he is part of my budget. If I even try to do the laundry he is like "No, I got it" Worth every red cent.\n\nEdit: Thank you oh kind ones for the Silverssss \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb4\nEdit: And the GOLD awesome reddit person!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x98\nEdit: Platinum, I curtsy to you'

###### b"You're a fucking genius."
###### b'LMFAO this was the best read to date. He has sucker written all over his forehead. Makes me wonder what other sucker events occur in your household.'
###### b'I wonder if he knows but plays along because he loves you \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
###### b'Honestly I\xe2\x80\x99m just surprised he even thinks to check the pockets, my husband just dumps the basket in the wash lol. Toys, pens, chapstick - all been washed. \n\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t complain though, because at least he\xe2\x80\x99s doing the laundry'
###### b'i wish i could put $5 in the dishes my roommates leave out'
###### b"Well I'm going to test this out on my wife this week and see if it makes her hate doing the laundry a little less. That would be a nice little stress reliever for her."
###### b'So you basically pay your husband to do housework instead of him just doing house work.'
###### b'Modern problems require modern solutions.'
###### b'YOU! You know all the secrets to have husbands do things around the house! Teach us mere mortals, oh wise one!'
###### b'To get my boy friend to text me back while he is working like if I need an immediate answer. I will Venmo him money. Because he won\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge a text from anyone but if he hears the cha-Ching he will be like what? Who\xe2\x80\x99s sending me money and why? I\xe2\x80\x99ll just send him a dollar and then he always sends it back. Lol. \n\n\nProbably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work if I did this on a weekly basis. But Ive done it a couple of times to really get his attention lol.'
###### b"Is he really such a sucker though? He really is getting $5-$10 extra every week just by doing a chore. I would do everyone's laundry in the house if that meant an allowance"
###### b"My husband and I. Since we are both men share many of the same clothes.  \nI always put what I want him to wear at the front of his side of the closet.  That way I can be sure we won't end up too matchy matchy and I can wear what I want lol \xf0\x9f\x98\x82"
###### b'He is so lucky, all I find in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s pants pockets is other guys phone numbers.'

###### b'Now you need to up your game and take the money from his wallet.'

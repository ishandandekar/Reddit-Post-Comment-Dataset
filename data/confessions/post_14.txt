## My daughter was granted a Make A Wish and I'm sad
#### b"My daughter has a rare blood disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopedia pupura (immune) which causes her immune system to destroy her platelets so she just bleeds, randomly. Her eye just hemmoraged a few weeks ago and an entire half was filled with blood, today, five hour nose bleed. She can feel when they're coming and she sits down with her bloody nose kit, tissues, a trash bag, a puke bucket for when she swallows too much blood and vomits, gauze, cold packs. My daughter is four. \nI have been able to convince myself for almost three years that ya, she is sick, but not THAT sick. Last week we spent four days at the hospital for severe anemia and no detectable platelets. She is THAT sick. I get it now. She is getting a wish, and she is getting worse because she is that sick. \nWe have tried every medication available for treatment of this disease. Nothing helps. Nothing fixes it. My heart is broken. "

###### b'I work very closely with MAW in my state and it is a fantastic organization. Please know that many wish kids go on to lead healthy lives. Getting a wish granted doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99ve determined the case is terminal, rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the diagnosis is \xe2\x80\x9cmedically eligible\xe2\x80\x9d and the nature of the condition *may* be life threatening. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for you and your daughter to have to go through a sickness like this at the age of 4. But if it provides you any comfort, there are many, many kids granted wishes who come out the other side and there is certainly no threshold that a child must be a certain level of sickness to qualify. All the best to you and your family as you fight this.\n\nEdited to add asterisks for emphasis'
###### b'As a fellow parent who\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was also granted a wish to Disney World. My advice for you. Enjoy it. Take the time to just be a kid with your kid. Special Needs parents spend so much time wondering about the next day, week, month etc. We sometimes forget how much fun being a parent of an awesome kid can be. \n\nThe wish may be granted for the child, but especially on the trip wishes, it really meant to allow the family to do something they rarely get to do. Be a family, having fun, without all the worry. \n\nMy wife has since become a Wish Grantor for the Organization. She loves it. She keeps getting unique wishes as well. Her first one was building a Wheel Chair Accessible Tree House. Was quite the build. \n\nI know this is hard time, when my daughter passed due her disability, it was hard on us as well. Not going to try and diminish your anguish on this issue. Especially when you know it coming. \n\nBut I will offer up this advice, take the time to live and have fun whenever possible. And do something for yourself now and then. '
###### b'Hi, Samantha! \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry to hear what you are going through with your daughter. I also suffer from ITP. I apologize if this has been asked before, or if you have already tried this route, but have you tried a drug called Promacta? I went through every treatment available to my doctors at the time, and this drug had kept my platelets stable for a few years. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for everybody, but I figured I\xe2\x80\x99d reach out just in case this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been presented as an option! My best wishes are with you and your family. '
###### b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to fathom a response to this. I just know I want to hug you. '

###### b"She is lucky to have you.\n\nExactly how you're lucky to have her."
###### b"I'm really sorry, I teared up reading this especially when you said that she sits down waiting for it to happen at such a young age. I don't know how to handle a situation like this but my advice is to just enjoy all the time that you have with her, that if you have to get away for a minute for you to completely let all the tears out is okay. Just give her all of your time because I think that what she wants the most, you're an awesome parent by trying to make her happy. I'm sending you a lot of hugs and to wish that you stay strong."
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re all going through this and that she has this illness. I understand your sadness. When my son who was born with basically half of a heart survived his surgeries, I was of course overjoyed to have him alive, but I was sad when it hit me that I had a child who would qualify for a wish. \n\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t up doing it, but now I wish we had. I had guilt over the fact that we could afford to take them to Disney on our own. And back then you could bring a medical note that allowed the entire family to bypass all lines all day, so we did that. But hearing from other families who\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through MAW, they really go all out for the kids.\n\nI wish now we had given him something money couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten, like meeting his favorite baseball player.\n\nMy son is (thankfully) too old now. So don\xe2\x80\x99t be like me. Take the trip and make wonderful stress-free memories. '
###### b'My friend\'s daughter has two rare heart conditions and has had multiple open heart surgeries. She is now on the donor list for a transplant.\n\nShe struggles so much to accept that eveything they do for her is palliative. She constantly gets "if  she was really sick you wouldn\'t/would do _____" comments.  It\'s hard to walk the line between giving her girl a childhood and protecting her. There are parents out there who know what you\'re dealing with.'
###### b'My niece is 4 years old and last year on January 18,2018 at 10:30a.m was when my world stopped when my sister was holding my niece in her arms and she told me that my niece has cancer leukemia ALL  . That she has to have three years of chemotherapy . Long story short  next month she gets to use her make a wish and there going to Disney world . I\xe2\x80\x99m beyond happy and excited that she gets to go and have fun and be a kid and dress like a Disney princess and enjoy being a 4 year old because she deserves the world this has been the hardest year yet her fighting cancer and everything that goes with it.  She is the strongest 4 year old  I know and goes through getting her treatments like a champ she has had numerous spinal tabs and blood transfusions and chemotherapy but yet she still smiles through it and just enjoying life.  She is amazing and she will kick cancer  ass \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f  enjoy Disney world with your little one and takes lots and lots of pictures . Enjoy every minute of it \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f God bless '
###### b"My dad had trouble with that a few years ago and they ended up trying a new treatment called winrho sdf. It hadn't been used in the state of Nebraska before. He's recovered now and asked me to post in hopes that it'll help in case it hadn't been an option to you. We are praying for you and wish to give you all the hugs."
###### b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I saw it on here anywhere but does your daughter get platelet transfusions?  I donate every two weeks and if you\xe2\x80\x99re nearby me, I can sign up to direct donate for her if we are the same blood type. '
###### b"I'm so sorry, I can't begin to imagine how you feel. The only advice I can think of is to just be strong for her and be there right at her side as she works through it. Never give up faith in her."
###### b'No words, just hugs x '

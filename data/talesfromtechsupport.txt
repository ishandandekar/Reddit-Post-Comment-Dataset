##### b"This is another good example of how an angry grumpy user isn't always a bad person or shitty user. Sometime they are just so frustrated at the difficulty of their day to day life by having a slow or crashing computer.  \nSometimes they just need a little TLC. "

##### b'And this is why we put up with ass chewing after ass chewing, weapons-grade stupidity and ignorance on a daily basis, and pointless meetings...that one moment where something small has such a huge, positive impact on the person that goes way beyond help desk metrics and SLA compliance.\n\nEDIT: forgot a couple words'

##### b"I like this story, a lot, and as a father I wonder if you realize what you really did for them. Imagine working, growing a life, career, getting married, then maybe between 30-40 you have a beautiful boy. Your hopes, dreams, legacy, all culminated in this new little human.\n\nThen the worst of the worst happens, anger, frustration, financial strain, blame, loss and then years later you lose every image of your child. \n\nMaybe you can't have another, maybe it's too late in life. Every day after that for years you try to hang on to the memories of who they almost were and hold on to what they looked like, sounded, smelled, felt like, all the while fading as time tends to do.\n\nSure you remember, but the most subtle details of a photo bring back so much, the way their hair was, their favourite shirt, the goofy smiles. To me that is very scary, to not even be able to look and remember, particularly in an age where there is so much visual record of things, we rely less and less on our memory and more on the ability to access those memories.\n\nThen to have those back by chance, is incredible. I can tell you that night and many nights after they were looking at those photos crying, laughing, seeing and recalling all the little details of children that make them so special to us. You brought him back to them in a way.\n\nI wonder if they look at his picture before they go to sleep, hoping to dream about him, be with him, if only for a while.\n\nedit: TY for the gold and my highest comment thing! Go hug your kid, family, friend, loved one!\n\n"

##### b"This is part of the reason that I *never* wipe a device with personal data, and *never* neglect to save personal data. I've got a hard drive at my desk with about 100GB of personal photos from employees that are gone, but I'm not wiping it. They might come back years from now and ask for pictures of a dead loved one or something, so a few old, slow (but functional) HDDs are worth it."

##### b"I had the opposite thing happen. I did 23 & Me and found out that my first cousins, who I'm not close with (they were estranged for a long time from my dad's brother), also had done 23 & Me because it matched us as first cousins.\n\nI told my dad this and he was like wait, it said that Karen is your first cousin? And I was like yeah? And he asked to see it and then he said, I have to call my brother.\n\nTurned out that my uncle has been convinced for decades that his ex-wife had an affair and his youngest daughter, Karen, wasn't really his.\n\nTurns out she has been this whole time."

##### b'My father also used the AncestryDNA kit. He didn\'t find anything unusual in the results, exactly what he thought it would be. But something weird did happen after he checked the box to allow "close matches" to contact him.\n\nWell, soon after he gets contacted by a woman he had never met who lives over a thousand miles away from him, saying that Ancestry told her that the two of them are cousins. Genealogical records show no relation, but she told my Dad that of her three siblings, only one of them had the "expected" ancestry report. Their parents were no longer living, so no one to ask.\n\nAnyway, upon further conversation, my Dad finds out that when this woman was born, she lived in the same city as most of my Dad\'s family. So he asks her to send him a picture, and he swears, "It\'s uncle Louie in a wig!"'

##### b'This actually just happened to some non-direct relatives of mine, essentially my uncles in-laws. \n\nHis brother in law and the wife have three kids who all did 23AndMe, and found out the oldest girl is not his daughter, but some other guy that his wife slept with early on in their marriage, got pregnant and thought she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to hide it forever (the daughters like 32 now so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have at home DNA tests back then and she probably never foresaw that being a thing). Long story short we kind of always knew because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like anyone else in that family but when they found out they all flipped on their mom about it and now the parents are getting divorced.\n\nMerry fucking Christmas'

##### b"Shit, now I'm remembering how my mom didn't want me to get a 23 and me kit last Christmas. Her reasoning was that it was a waste of 99 dollars and I could just average the results from her and my father's exams..."

##### b"I was at an eclipse party, and met a guy with a VERY interesting 23andMe story.\n\nHe was adopted, and had taken the test a couple of years ago.  To his surprise, he had something like 10 half-siblings from his father's side, from all over the country.  After contacting them, he learned that his bio-father was a serial rapist that had never been caught."

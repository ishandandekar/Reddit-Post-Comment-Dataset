## The man on my patio.
#### b'Warning: Long post, but I recommend you to read it all. \n\nOk, so this happened when I was around 9 years old (25 now) and It\xe2\x80\x99s something I will never forget. It gives me goosebumps to this day. \n\nI live in a terraced house (four houses combined) and my neighbors and I each have our own little patio. There\xe2\x80\x99s a small road 10 meters from my yard where people do their Sunday walks and so on. Only a small fence separates my small yard and patio from that road. I live in a pretty crowded area, with several of these terraced houses spread around in my neighborhood, so seeing people walking on that road is pretty normal for me. Seeing random people standing on my patio is not. \n\nWhen I was 9 I usually got home from school about an hour before my mom got home from work. I live maybe 50 meters away from school so my mom figured I was mature enough to be home alone for around an hour before she got home. This one day I got home from school. I did the usual thing which was to make sure I locked the front door, and double checked that the back door leading to the patio was also locked. (I was 9, being alone was a little scary even though it was in the middle of the day and only for one hour) I then rushed to my room upstairs to play as much PlayStation as possible before my mom came home and made me do homework. \n\nWhile playing, I heard this noise coming from outside my window. (My room was located one floor over the patio, with a view to the road I told you about before) It was kinda like the sound of a cat. But my cat had been missing for over three months. Hope sparked and I thought \xe2\x80\x9cOMG, did he finally come back?!\xe2\x80\x9d I ran downstairs to check if it was my cat, but the sight that met me gives me goosebumps just writing this. \n\nThere was a guy standing on my patio. A tall guy with black hair covering half of his eyes, making him look like a male version of the ring women or something. I could hear him making high pitched sounds, almost like a cat meowing. A brown liquid was running down from his mouth, and I could see him spitting out my dads stomped cigarettes. He was actually eating from the ashtray. I was frozen observing this, eventually snapped out of it and screamed so loud that the man must have heard it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t react, he kept on eating from the ashtray. \n\nI ran upstairs to my room, locked the door and called my mom who then called the cops. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been more terrified in my life. Laying in bed under my sheets, shivering with fear, as I hear these creepy high pitched noises from the guy eating cigarette stomps from the ashtray on my patio. \n\nI kinda blacked out for a moment, because the next thing I remember is the police arriving on the road by my yard. I hear them talking to the guy saying stuff like \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGet over here or we will come down and arrest you\xe2\x80\x9d and so on. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, but the high pitched sounds was more frequent and louder. I decided to look through the window, feeling safe now that the cops were there. \n\nI could see two police officers standing by my fence, one man and a woman. I did not see the creepy man however, because he was standing directly one story under me and my field of view. The police jumped the fence, and I remember hearing the creepy guy screaming louder than anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard before. He charged the female police officer with full force, and he fucking knocked her out cold. The male officer then immediately tazed the guy, leaving him shaking on the ground, screaming still. The police man struggled to keep him on the ground while putting handcuffs on him, but eventually made it. \n\nAfter a while  he managed to wake up the female police officer, who seemed to be badly hurt. He called for backup and an ambulance, and then he sees me standing in the window above him. The expression on my face must have been something else, because he just looked at me and said \xe2\x80\x9cI sure as hell hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see all that\xe2\x80\x9d I started to cry. By this time neighbors started to arrive wondering what the hell was going on. One of my neighbors, an elderly woman, made me come down and she took care of me until my mom came back home. The police took the creepy guy with them in the car and left. Before they left they promised to come back and talk to us about what had happened. \n\nThis is where the story takes an unexpected turn. The male police officer came back later that night and sat down with me and my mom to talk. He explained that the guy on my patio was actually diagnosed with severe autism. He had escaped a facility where mentally challenged people lived, located around 5 km from where I live. He explained that the guy had actually been living in my house 5 years ago but he had been forced to move when his mom, his only caretaker, died. The poor guy probably thought he would find his mom in my house. He missed the routines and he missed living there with his mom. The police had to move him from the house that time 5 years ago, because he was extremely strong (From what I heard he had extreme tensions in the body because of the autism, making his muscles grow stronger and stronger throughout the years) This was the reason he reacted the way he did when the police came this day. Still frightened I told the police officer that he needed to make sure this would never happen again. He promised it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \n\nAfter a few sleepless nights my life got back to normal. The years went by and the guy didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. Until one year ago. At this time my mom and dad had moved out, I bought the house from them and I\xe2\x80\x99m still living there today. I was enjoying my morning coffee on the patio when I see this random guy stopping on the road by my fence. He just stands there, looking at me. I look at him and give him a nod. And then I hear the high pitched noises. \xe2\x80\x9cHoly shit it\xe2\x80\x99s him\xe2\x80\x9d his hair had turned grey but the high pitched sounds made me realize. My heart started racing and I instantly remembered the reason why he was back. I realized that he must have managed to escape again. Because I kept my cool a bit longer then when was 9, I started to realize how sorry I felt for the guy. 16 years later and he was back to look for his mom. I decided to carefully ask him if he wanted to come down to the patio. He instantly jumped the fence. I started to think he would knock me out like he did to that police officer. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He smiled. He looked at me and smiled. \n\nI offered him to sit down. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond. I offered him to come inside. He started laughing. We went inside. His face lit up, pure joy. He was home. It reminded him of the life he had with his mom. It almost made me tear up. All of a sudden he sat down in my couch, turned on my tv and switched directly to the cartoons. I observed him for a while, he was just completely focused on the cartoons. I just wanted him to enjoy the moment so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to him. I realized I had to call the facility to let them know. The caretakers arrived 10 minutes later. After a lot of convincing he got back up, crying, and they went back to the facility. I called the facility two days later. We made a deal. \n\nHis name is Tom, and I now consider Tom my friend. Every Sunday from the day he returned, Tom and his caretakers visit me to watch cartoons. They say it\xe2\x80\x99s the highlight of his week. It makes my heart warm. Now, for several years my thoughts were \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s NOT meet, guy on my patio eating from the ashtray\xe2\x80\x9d now my thoughts are \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s meet every Sunday to watch cartoons, my friend Tom\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n'

###### b"Great, now I have something in my eyes. They won't stop watering. You are an awesome person.\n\nI met an autistic kid once while I was working as a furniture repair tech.  I came to the house and the issue was the arm of their sofa was collapsed. It turned out that it was the autistic boys favorite spot to sit, stand, lay, and jump on. I could have just walked out and said the customer had broken it and it wasn't covered under warranty. Instead I spent a few hours turning that sofa arm into the most sturdy and comfortable item of furniture in the entire house. Several 2x4s, thick foam padding, and long wood screws later and that kid had the best spot in the house. It would have taken a sledge hammer to break that arm down again.\n\nAfter I let him roll my van windows down about 50 times (he really liked power windows) he gave me a hug and I left. His mother called me the next day and insisted I stop by the house as soon as possible, she wanted to thank me. I told her that wasn't at all necessary but she was relentless. I stopped by on my way home and she forced, seriously I tried to decline, a $100 bill in my hand with tears in her eyes.\n\nI know I'm not a very good story teller but I love thinking about how I helped them out and how much they appreciated it. I just wanted to share. "
###### b"This gave me chills, and brought me to tears.. you're fucking awesome. I'm glad Tom has you in his life. "
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m the mother of an autistic son. I\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful you are in the world and your kindness has allowed a motherless son to come home each Sunday. \n\nWalk in Beauty, Friend of Tom.'
###### b'As someone who has a sibling with autism, this made my heart so warm. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a world where my little sister was without me, my brother, or my parents. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to know that even if she walks up to a strangers door step, eating whatever she finds on the way, that she could be welcome into that stranger\xe2\x80\x99s home. Go Tom and go you! \n\nThanks! This brightened my day! '
###### b"My son has autism and when he is happy he is infectiously happy, like you described Tom while watching cartoons. This story made me really sad. You're doing something good though."
###### b'You know not many people like you would let a stranger like that into their home. You sent chills up my spine and brought a tear to my eye. You gave Tom a chance to find happiness without being scared you are such a lovely person. \xe2\x99\xa1'
###### b'This took a very pleasant turn in the end! I felt like such a jackass when it was revealed that he was autistic because I was dead set thinking in my head that the behavior had to be due to drugs, mostly thanks to the popular nature of this sub. You are so very sweet to see him every Sunday. This story made me so happy!'
###### b'As sweet as this story is, I sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s fake. Some of the facts in it are complete bullshit. I guess this is an easy way to get attention and sympathy from naive strangers though. If it is real though, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful story. '
###### b"I'm actually cringing at the amount of people believing this story is real."
###### b'Autism does not make your muscles "grow stronger". This is legitimately the least researched or thought out bullshit I have ever read. Duped a lot of people though, so good for you on the useless internet points. '
###### b"Can't believe this fake shit got more attention than the Aurora shooting "
###### b"That's such a nice turn of event! Your very generous to let him in like this :)"
###### b'* The man that caused a traumatizing experience for you as a child shows up 16 years later. You had justification to call the police, but you invite him into your home to keep him calm.\n\n* When faced with calling the police or the mental health facility, you chose the far less traumatizing option.\n\n* This could have all been put behind you, but you make a deal that he can visit regularly.\n\nYour compassion and the way you handled this situation are honorable. The world needs people like you.'
###### b'Did your cat ever come back?'

## Creepy dude in the pharmacy with a weird fetish
#### b"This happened maybe 10 years ago when I was in my early 30's. I was standing in line at the local pharmacy to get my prescriptions. This is a small town and I am a regular there, so they know me on sight. I was behind a couple of other people in line, and there were a couple of people behind me.\n\nI kept feeling a tickle in my hair in the back of my head, but every time I looked behind me, the guy there was a few steps back and looking at the floor. This happened several times by the time I was at the front of the line. The pharmacist told me she wanted to talk to me about my medication in the consultation room they had at the time (since converted to a bathroom). I thought this was weird because we both knew I had been on this medication for years and would be for life. Nothing new.\n\nI get back to the room and close the door, and she comes in from the door at the other side that leads from the pharmacy. She told me that the man behind me had been stepping forward, sticking his nose in my hair, and smelling, before stepping back and looking at the floor. This shook me pretty badly as this is such weird behavior, especially in my little town.\n\nThe pharmacy staff insisted on having me wait there until the guy was distracted (by another pharmacy employee), and they had a security guard walk me to my car and watch me drive off, to make sure I was gone before Hair Sniffer came out and saw what I was driving and what direction I was going. \n\nI still use this pharmacy and some of the same people still work there. I will always be grateful that they took the initiative to make sure I was safe that day."

###### b'Props to the pharmacist for taking care of you. '
###### b'Good call on the pharmacy staff; they deserve a lot of credit for that. I would think most people would just shrug it off. '
###### b'So sweet that the store employees worked together to keep you safe! '
###### b'Sounds pretty hair raising.\n\nSeriously though, glad you are ok op'
###### b"I've been a pharmacist for nearly a decade now and I'm still waiting for something crazy like this to happen at work. \n\nGlad they had security and a consultation room! Sounds better than where I work. "
###### b'I\'m really glad that that they took care of you. It was really thoughtful and caring but I can\'t help but wish that instead they called this creep out. I know it\'s asking a lot but everyone bent over backwards to have this guy suffer no consequences for his actions. \n\nAgain, I realize that the staff went above and beyond to protect this women and that really is the most important thing but I can\'t help but wish that someone would have been like, "hey, perv, what the fuck do you think you\'re doing?!" Maybe he would have thought twice next time. '
###### b'3/4 fucking creepy and 1/4 hilarious. Great pharmacist, props to her. '
###### b"I don't get why they didn't call the security guard to tell the creep to knock it off.  These assholes need to be told that we see what they're doing and that their behavior is not acceptable.\n\nDid you ever see that guy again?  "
###### b'Hopefully the creepy dude was filling a prescription for an ass whuppin'
###### b'something similar happend to me, I was on a train and a old asian guy was next to me, I was feeling unconfurtable cuz this guy seem to keep staring at me, but I just try to ignore him and just listen to my music, until a guy in front of me made some signal with his hand to get my attention, I took  my headphones off and he told me this guys was sniffing me and to better move to another train, I am so glad this guy help me, cuz I was way to shy to do something by my own!!\n\nI am glad they help you! '
###### b'Something similar happened to me at school a while back. I\xe2\x80\x99m a female and had taken weightlifting as a PE class and there was this guy who was more or less obsessed with me. He\xe2\x80\x99d always follow me around during class like a lost puppy, and would stand a little too close to me when the coach was talking. Long story short, my spotter caught him sniffing my hair while I was doing dumbbell rows. She told me and next time he did it, I threw my dumbbell at him. Luckily it hit him in the balls. My coach asked me why I threw it, and I told him that the kid came up and startled me. The dude had to spend the rest of the day in the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s office. I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad he stopped being a creepy stalker. '
###### b'Glad that you have never seen him again at the pharmacy, and glad that the employees there were so caring!'
###### b'of my good what a weird guy, it makes me anxious just to think something like that happening to me \n'
###### b'God that is terrible, I hate getting close to people, that would make me lose my mind if I found that out @_@'
###### b'If I was the pharmacist\xe2\x80\x99s assistant or the security guard, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to resist saying, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re kind of a weird fucker aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPut him on notice and hopefully he is too embarrassed to come back to that pharmacy. Hopefully makes him think twice about doing that to any other women.'

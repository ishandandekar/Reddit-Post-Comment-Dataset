## Man on train decides he doesn't like how I sit, tries to intimidate me.
#### b'This happened to me about a month ago but it still boggles me.\n\nTwo points of background to make this story make sense: \n\n1)I live in Tokyo and commute via those famously crazy crowded trains daily. There exists on them this kind of unspoken agreement that everyone works together to make this suck as little as possible. People for the most part hold their backpacks in front of them, men don\'t manspread etc. But thats when the trains are full. About two stops before mine, the train goes from SARDINE CAN to everyone on this train could lay on the seats and have room left over. So usually I can sit down at this point.\n\n 2) I\'m not a Japanese woman. Very obviously so, even when I\'m in my white dress shirt and pencil skirt like all the other office drones. I\'m often the only obviously non-Japanese woman on my train in the morning. But despite my appearance, I\'m fluent in Japanese. \n\nSo one day I sit down when the train empties out, headphones in, mobile game going, ready to enjoy the 10 minutes of sitting I get on my hour commute. I\'m sitting with my legs crossed, but there\'s maybe 10 people in the whole car so I\'m not in anyones way.\n\nI\'m tuned out when all of a sudden a hand reaches out and grabs my bare knee (I\'m in a skirt). I of course jolt straight out of my skin, rip out my headphones and look up at the hand\'s owner. It\'s some skinny old japanese dude (60s???). He points at my legs, then at other people on the train (again, a max of ten in a car that can hold 50+ easily and probably held about 80 ten minutes ago). In slightly broken English he says \n\n"You must not cross legs"\n\nI\'m so bewildered by this I start to tell him in Japanese "The train isn\'t crowded right now, I\'m not in anyones way-" But he doesn\'t like this answer. He starts to reach for my legs again, presumedly to uncross my legs himself. I, liking even less of this, summon up my loudest non-scream "DON\'T TOUCH ME", and thankfully this is enough to get him to stop that, as another thing you don\'t do on trains here is make a fuss. \n\nSadly though, yet another thing you don\'t do here is get involved. So despite a woman all but screaming "Don\'t touch me", its some foreign woman causing trouble, best not to get involved etc etc so no one comes over. So while I\'ve made it clear that I will not stand for physical confrontation, this old dude still feels comfortable enough to stand directly in front of me, nearly knee to knee, looming over me while he repeats endlessly \n\n"You. Must."\n\nHe did this for at least five minutes. \nI didn\'t move. I didn\'t blink or break eye contact. I started plans B through P of how to get off this train at the next stop. Thankfully he gave up before the next stop, shaking his head and calling me a "rude bitch" in Japanese before wandering off.\n\nStill take the same train but haven\'t seen him since.\n\nLets not meet again leg police fucker, lest you find out what happens when you loom over a girl at dick punting height. \n\nEdit: removed double negative'

###### b'Just going forward, let\'s get a few things straight:\n\n1. Crossing your legs in Japan is technically more impolite, but no one actually gives a flying fuck outside of formal events.  Especially on a train.  Especially in Tokyo of all places.  *Unless* of course you are impeding movement during rush hour, which doesn\'t seem to apply in this scenario, but that\'s pretty common etiquette around the world.\n\n2. *However* even if it is impolite, this does not give *anyone* the right to reach over and grab someone to physically make them conform.\n\n3. Japan is full of odd quirks and rules, but please don\'t take this as the norm (for those who have not been to Japan).  Japanese are, overall, fairly friendly or helpful.  Even to foreigners.  Sure, you\'re going to get an asshole every once in a while, but that doesn\'t mean the whole country is rotten, so let\'s not go on a circle jerk about how much Japan sucks and all that nonsense.\n\n4. Anyone else who gives the "but it\'s the culture!!" or "you should have known better" bullshit excuses are getting permabans.  There is way too much bs in this thread.  Just because it\'s "culture" doesn\'t make certain behaviors automatically excusable, unless you guys are also okay with women being treated as subhuman and child marriages. \n\n5. Also another reminder that advocating violence (one way or another) is a no go. '

###### b"I admire your backbone in this story. Wouldn't have thought any less of someone for avoiding the confrontation altogether."
###### b'The old time classic "I harass you, but when you dont do what I say YOU are the rude one"'
###### b'>Sadly though, yet another thing you don\'t do here is get involved. So despite a woman all but screaming "Don\'t touch me", its some foreign woman causing trouble, best not to get involved etc etc so no one comes over.\n\nScary how shit can go down without anyone giving a damn. \n\n&#x200B;'
###### b'You should always report incidents like this to the train station security. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Japan (Sagamihara/ Machida) for a few years and I have reported the Nigerians on the train who will brazenly ask for sex. They may not catch them right away, but they will do something about it. '
###### b"I am also a female living in Tokyo, and definitely have my fair share of tales about weirdos on trains. It's almost exclusively oyajis on the chuo-sobu line.\n"
###### b'[removed]'
###### b'Asshole tries to touch without consent but YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE the rude one'
###### b'The thought of a random man reaching to uncross your legs for you makes me cringe so hard. Good for you for yelling at him!'
###### b"I used to have weird stuff like that happen to ne when I lived in Tokyo. I have red hair and tattoos so I already attracted attention, but I pretty much just had to intimidate people away when they bothered me in the same way you did. I've had people (always male) go so far as it actually touch my back, like touch my skin where I have tattoos. But usually I could just turn around and stare them down until they were so uncomfortable they put plenty of space between us. "
###### b'Dick punting... I\xe2\x80\x99m never, never ever gonna let anyone play that game against me. '
###### b"Apparently crossing your feet is very rude in Japan. Still doesn't make it right for him to touch you. "
###### b'Definitely understandable! It\xe2\x80\x99s mind-boggling to me that anyone would think it\xe2\x80\x99s OK to do that. I realize that the culture is very different there compared to here in the U.S., but still, that sounds more like an asshole.'
###### b'Wait why can\xe2\x80\x99t you cross your legs when the trains crowded? I thought crossing your legs (at least in the position women tend to do) is more compact since one leg is on top of the other. I find myself doing it a lot when I have to sit squished next to someone'

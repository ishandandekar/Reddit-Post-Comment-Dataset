## I (a pizza guy) intercepted a kidnapping during a delivery
#### b'I deliver pizza and I\xe2\x80\x99d been having a really busy night, non-stop back and forth, without any time to even pause and take a leak. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been so busy that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really thinking about bathroom breaks. But we\xe2\x80\x99re also going through a bit of a heat wave in our area, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been drinking copious amounts of water. \n\nAll of a sudden as I was driving to this particular delivery, the urge to go hit me. Like, things went from 0 to 60 in an instant. Thankfully I was close to the customer so could get this one over with quickly. Or so I thought. \n\nI pulled up to the house, and it was an area I\xe2\x80\x99d delivered in before, so I could immediately see that something wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right. All the lights were off in the house, not even the glow of a television or anything. It was extra apparent because the streetlight closest to the door happened to be out of order. And on top of it all, the block was dead quiet. \n\nThis is a big university area, and obviously there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many student renters in July, but there had to be at least one person, because someone ordered this pizza. \n\nMaybe they just liked sitting in the dark or they were out back in the yard, whatever, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get out of my car and knock on a quiet house in the middle of the night (around 9:30pm) without first checking that I had the correct address and the customer was inside. \n\nIt was scorching that night, even after sundown.  My car\xe2\x80\x99s A/C is a joke, and the piping hot pizzas don\xe2\x80\x99t help things much, so I have to try and open the car door as infrequently as possible to keep any cool air in. \n\nI called the number the customer provided and the voice on the other end said, kind of brusquely and out of breath, \xe2\x80\x9cYah?\xe2\x80\x9d I just tried to keep it clear and concise, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, it\xe2\x80\x99s your pizza out front but there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be anybody home?\xe2\x80\x9d And the customer replied, still gasping for air, \xe2\x80\x9cYah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not home.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI had to pee *so* badly by that point that I was much less patient than I\xe2\x80\x99d otherwise be with a customer right out of the gate, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to terminate the order, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived in the stated delivery window and you were supposed to pay in cash, so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to tell you. Plan ahead next time.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI instantly regretted letting my bladder do the talking for me as the voice on the other end came through more clearly as a young, bubbly, and very distraught girl who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been older than 20 or 25.  \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my gosh I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I was running down the street so I could barely hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d She cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI just switched you out of my AirPods. Is that better? Sorry, I completely lost track of time at work, but I knew you were coming, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m literally *running* home right now. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t leave, I\xe2\x80\x99m starving and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a car. Seriously, please don\xe2\x80\x99t leave. Five minutes tops, ok?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be hungry, and running late, and have no car but not live near any restaurants. Plus when I heard her voice I began to remember more specifically having delivered to this place a couple times before, and she\xe2\x80\x99d always been perfectly nice. Now I felt bad for snapping at her. I tried to walk it back, while simultaneously looking out my window for potential spots to pee. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my bad, I\xe2\x80\x99m letting the heat get to me and it\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault. No need to rush. See you when you get here.\xe2\x80\x9d I hung up and, while surveilling the street, was starting to think I was really out of luck. \n\nAll the other houses had people in them, and were close together, so there were no clumps of trees or out of the way patches of land or anything. Of course I had just tossed my empty water bottle at the last delivery, because I\xe2\x80\x99m an idiot. \n\nFinally, I decided it was escalating to the point of an emergency, and the safest bet was to use a bush in front of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s house. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t home. The street light was out so no one would see me. The people who were home were inside. My car was parked across the street and we\xe2\x80\x99re a small shop who don\xe2\x80\x99t wear uniforms, so if someone did spot me, they\xe2\x80\x99d have no way to connect me to my employer. Animals pee outside all the time, humans are animals... this is fine. \n\nI scurried over to the tallest bush in her front yard. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have much of a yard, more just a walkway lined with bushes and flowers that ran adjacent to her front door. The biggest cluster of bushes, the only one where I could be sure there would be no visible splatter on the side of the house, was about four feet from her door. \n\nI looked both ways, unzipped, and let fly. After the initial millisecond of relief, I noticed the sound was way off, more like pissing on something solid than something leafy. \n\nI started panicking, thinking I\xe2\x80\x99d aimed wrong. But once I start, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop mid-stream, so I kept squinting into the darkness to see if maybe I was hitting a key rock or something and could just move a few inches over. Instead, all of a sudden, I heard a way more concerning noise. A deep voice exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the fuck?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nAnd before I could turn around, assuming I\xe2\x80\x99d been caught by a neighbor, a *man* came leaping *out of the bushes.*\n\nHe blew by me, brushing my golden shower off him as did. He spit pretty emphatically on the ground, so I think I might\xe2\x80\x99ve beaned him right in the face. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see where he went after a few paces but, though this next part is kind of a blur, I do think I remember hearing a car screech out from a bit further away after a minute. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d gotten some night vision by that point so I was able to make out his height, build, and outfit, but only the most general details of each. \n\nI was in such shock that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even put my dick away. I just stood there trying to figure out what had happened. The reality was so terrifying that my mind refused to accept it, and impulsively searched for a reasonable explanation that could make everything ok.\n\nI thought, \xe2\x80\x9cCould these bushes lead to some backyard area and just looked like they were against the house? Could they have been obscuring an open window?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nMy inner voice was desperately screaming \xe2\x80\x9cBruh that man was wearing a hoodie in 90 degree weather. That was a bad man. You\xe2\x80\x99re in a bad situation.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nBut the very idea that I was within inches of a guy who would be hiding in bushes at all, let alone in front of a young woman\xe2\x80\x99s house at night, just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something I was ready to grapple with yet. I was coping by not coping. \n\nMy fight or flight response totally failed me at that point, because my dumb ass did the absolute last thing I should have done, and approached the bushes to try and validate this \xe2\x80\x9cThere must have been a good reason for a man in a hoodie to be behind these bushes in the middle of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d theory. \n\nSo I walked over to the side, turned on my phone flashlight, and tried to peer around the line of shrubbery. \n\nPro tip, as scary as things may look in the dark, seeing them with a single beam of your flashlight can sometimes make it even worse. That\xe2\x80\x99s when I saw the bag. \n\nThere was a tattered drawstring bag sitting behind the bushes. Slightly splashed with pee. But I was in such a moronic daze from shock that I groped around for it thinking \xe2\x80\x9cSee? This is it, this will explain why he was back here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt explained it. Once I maneuvered it over and pulled it open I saw a sharp knife, a roll of duct tape, and a bottle of pills. The delusions officially broke at that point and all the adrenaline, endorphins, and self preservation instincts that had been suppressed kicked in ten times over. \n\nI became whatever the opposite of dazed is. More laser focused than I have ever been in my life, with one singular goal: \xe2\x80\x9cGet back to my car.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI dropped the bag, booked it across the street, got in my car, and slammed the pedal to the floor before the door was even all the way closed. I went as far as I could as fast as I could until I hit a red signal, then I pulled off to the side and realized I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be driving anymore than necessary in the condition I was in. \n\nI pulled into the parking lot of a 24 hour drug store and took a breath. I was finally calm and coherent enough to zip up and formulate a plan of action. \n\nMy first lucid thought was \xe2\x80\x9cWho do I call first, the police or the girl whose house that was?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought about it for what couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have really been more than ten seconds, but felt like an hour, and decided \xe2\x80\x9cOk. I am in my locked car with the engine running. If trouble starts, I can drive away. I know somethings up, she might not, she needs to know not to keep walking in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d But as I was dialing her number, it occurred to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if there was no girl?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI thought I remembered delivering to that house before, but what if I was wrong? What if the girl on the phone was just a decoy to get me there to rob me, or worse? \n\nEvery pizza guy on the planet has seen the *Evil Genius* documentary by now, so I thought \xe2\x80\x9cShe called me all out of breath. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t home. The whole thing was off, can\xe2\x80\x99t risk it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the cops.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI called 911, the operator was very helpful in keeping me calm, because I was a complete wreck by this point. He kept assuring me that someone would be there soon. \n\nI kept telling them they had to get there before the girl did, but I was trying to express three thoughts at once, and really damaging my own credibility. It came out more as: \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to save this girl because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t after me I was just delivering a pizza. Unless they were after me, in which case there might not be a girl, but I talked to one on the phone, so then you should find that girl because they used her to lure me there. But if she\xe2\x80\x99s real she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the guy, who was also real, and there could be more guys if there\xe2\x80\x99s actually a girl, and you know what? Even if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a girl there might actually be more guys. I only checked one part of the bushes so I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll know which guy is the one I saw because I pissed all over him, you know. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to, this was back when I thought the girl was real but not home, but she might be real so you really need to find her if she is because the guy was real\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nFinally they basically just asked me to stop talking and stay on the line. But that was when I saw an incoming call from the customer. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer it without disrupting my 911 call, so I just ignored it. \n\nBut then she sent me this text like, \xe2\x80\x9cHey I\xe2\x80\x99m here, don\xe2\x80\x99t see you?\xe2\x80\x9d I told 911 she was there and they said officers were only minutes away. But who knows how long that meant? Especially after I\xe2\x80\x99d given such a scattered account of the events in my panic. \n\nI just felt overwhelmed with guilt. Because my rational mind said the odds of her being a decoy girl for some large scam targeting pizza guys were low and the odds of her being the intended victim of a predator were high. \n\nSo I put my 911 call on mute (where I can hear them but they can\xe2\x80\x99t hear me) and turned back, heart absolutely pounding out of my chest, compulsively muttering \xe2\x80\x9cFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,\xe2\x80\x9d the entire way. \n\nThen I took 911 off mute and told them I had returned to look for the girl. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy about that, but I saw her meandering past the parked cars in the street looking to see if one was mine, and I waved her down, flashing my brights. \n\nShe bounced on over to the window of my car, happy-go-lucky. I figured that was a good sign that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in on whatever this was. But I was just so scared to be back in the general area and to not know what had just happened or what was going to happen. I kept whispering \xe2\x80\x9cGet in. *Get in!*\xe2\x80\x9d And she was like, \xe2\x80\x9cGet it? Huh? Oh! You want me to get the pizza from the back?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make the same mistake with her that I had made with 911, so instead of trying to tell the whole story, I stuck to the bare basic facts. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a man in your bushes. I\xe2\x80\x99m on the phone with the police. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he is right now. Please get in the car so we can lock the doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI was barely able to get even those sentences out, and I was shaking like I\xe2\x80\x99d had 10 cups of black coffee. I held up my phone with 911 on the call screen to verify it for her. I thought that was why she got in the car with no further explanation, but it turns out that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely it. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou still there? Is she with you? Are you safe? Is anyone else there?\xe2\x80\x9d 911 kept checking in, not knowing who the third party I was talking to was.  I reassured them, and we drove, more cautiously this time, to a location 911 instructed us to wait at to speak with police after they cleared the area. \n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually have to do much after that. The police came pretty soon after, a police car met us, I gave a statement telling them everything I observed, and she went to go speak to more officers in more detail than they needed me for. \n\nIt turns out the reason she got right into a strange pizza guy\xe2\x80\x99s car without probing any deeper into my story is because she knew who the man was right away from my description. \n\nShe had an abusive ex-boyfriend who was apparently psychotic enough that he immediately came to mind from hearing \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a guy in your bushes.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nShe later called us to thank me and insist on leaving a huge tip. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there when the call came in so the kid who answered didn\xe2\x80\x99t know to refuse to accept the money. But the manager already promised the next time we see her we can load her up with enough \xe2\x80\x9cone free pie\xe2\x80\x9d cards to last a lifetime. \n\nEasily the scariest thing that has ever happened to me, on the job or off. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the chance to tell the story much, because I try to avoid sharing it with anyone who could possibly know the girl or know of the event. \n\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m still not the same since. Even though I know he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have anything to do with me directly, this truly shook me to my core. So, man in the bushes, let\xe2\x80\x99s not meet.'

###### b'I am so proud of you for doing the right thing! \nWhen I (F) was 22 I was delivering pizzas in a suburb of Memphis, TN. They tried to not send the girls to the bad areas, and my husband was a GM at another store. I had to deliver to a sketchy area one night and so I turned on all my find my phone and everyone knew where I was going. And when I got out of my car a teenage boy came up to me and said that it was a group of men that belonged to a certain gang who had ordered the pizza and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk up to the second floor apartment I should leave as fast as I can because \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t get many white girl deliveries here.\xe2\x80\x9d To which I promptly listened and got back in my car and left. Before I got back to the store they called complaining and said that the store needed to send the white girl back so they could teach her a lesson. \nI will forever be grateful to that kid who lord knows most teens just look the other way.

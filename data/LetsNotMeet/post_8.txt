## “He asked for me by name?” “Yes.” “Call 911. I’ve never seen him in my life.”
#### b'I was watching my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s kids while she and her husband go out of town. \n\nThey have a teenage daughter (let\xe2\x80\x99s say her name is Alyssa.) \n\nAt like 3am I\xe2\x80\x98m woken up by a weird rustling sound and look out the window and see movement. I saw a boy emerge from the bushes on the side of the house. I saw a bike tossed on the lawn that definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ours. \n\nMy first thought was it was a burglar casing houses, but since he looked young and came through on a bike, I figured scaring him straight would be enough for him to decide to head home. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin a teenager\xe2\x80\x99s life by calling the cops straightaway. \n\nSo I went out on the porch, flipped the lights on, and said \xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d In my classroom voice. \n\nThe guy looked surprised but not nervous. He was wearing a letterman style jacket, but once I got a clear view of him in the streetlights, he seemed much older than my granddaughter. Gruff. And more wirey than athletic. \n\nHe walked up closer to the house and said \xe2\x80\x9cYah I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for Alyssa.\xe2\x80\x9d I gave him a disapproving glare, hoping he\xe2\x80\x99d realize he came looking for a girl late at night and a grumpy old\nperson answered, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to split. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking what must\xe2\x80\x99ve happened is Alyssa knew her parents were going out of town and maybe before she knew I\xe2\x80\x99d be staying over told a secret older boyfriend to come over. \n\nIt was late and I was alone with several kids so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him coming any closer to the house. I also thought it was weird he came so late and wanted to be sure Alyssa actually wanted to talk to him. So I said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Who?\xe2\x80\x9d And he said Alyssa. You know, Alyssa Lastname. This is her house.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, he knew her full name, they must be at least friends. \n\nI said \xe2\x80\x9cyou wait there.\xe2\x80\x9d He started to walk up and I felt a sick burning in my gut. Instinct kicked in. I yelled \xe2\x80\x9cNO. STOP.  FREEZE\xe2\x80\x9d Then readjusted and said \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay right there. This is private property don\xe2\x80\x99t take a step closer. Wait. *There*.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nSo I go in and Alyssa is asleep just one room over from where the rustling first occurred and I wake her up and say something to the affect of \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the big idea was to have friends over this time of night but you tell them to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d She has no clue what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. \n\nI say \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a guy outside asking for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Confused, she gets up and goes to the window. She sees him and goes white as a sheet. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked for me?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYah.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBy name?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCall the police. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI called 911 immediately, but as I was on the phone with them, Alyssa started tugging at my arm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming up!\xe2\x80\x9d I had younger kids in the house to think about so I kept the door latched and pulled it just open enough for the latch and yelled \xe2\x80\x9cI asked my husband and none of us know an Alyssa Lastname. Leave my property or I\xe2\x80\x99m calling 911.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nHe got angry and started yelling for her to come out. Thankfully the police came pretty quickly and when he heard the sirens he grabbed the bike and ran off. I watched where he was running and he jumped into the passenger side of a car without headlights or front plates and sped off. \n\nThe police followed in the same direction once I pointed them. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get him. They advised us to take all her social media details offline if she was sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know this person and said they\xe2\x80\x99d had a couple similar reports recently and were looking into it. \n\nI got a heavy duty lock and she slept in my room for the remainder of my visit.'

###### b'Make sure her location is off on Snapchat! I work in a make your own pottery shop and the amount of children who 1. Have phones and 2. Have snap chat accounts blows my mind. But a lot of those children and many users of the app aren\xe2\x80\x99t aware that anyone who adds you can see your location if you don\xe2\x80\x99t change it in the settings. \nTook me a while to figure it out and know a few too many people who have had dangerous and creepy experiences because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn that setting off.'
###### b'Did she end up figuring out who it was? Like a social media follower or maybe a fellow classmate????'
###### b'Eurgh, the fact he arrived by bike but had a getaway car standing by (with someone else in it) is super creepy. Did she ever post on social media that her parents were going to be away?'
###### b'Your reaction about saying an Alyssa doesnt live here and then later that you asked your husband about it.... that so smart I am so going to use that if the opportunity ever arises!'
###### b"It's a good thing she could see out of the window and notify you he was coming, or else things could have gotten extremely out of hand.. I wonder what he wanted.. what his goal was.. glad you're all safe for now, be on the lookout and security cameras if you can afford them"
###### b'Hey OP, this sounds scary and super weird he knows the exact location. Ask Alyssa if she has snapchat, then tell her to delete anyone she doesn\'t know, then go into her settings and tell her to turn on "Ghost Mode" when reading this I just had the idea that maybe someone knows her location through that app, as if you\'re not savvy with your settings anyone who adds you or you add back can see your location. It\'s a form of social media through an app on a phone. Just worth checking and wanted to bring to your attention in case it\'s overlooked.   \n\n\nIf she does have snapchat see if she has been adding it to the Snapchat teams stories, it makes stories visible and shows the location as well. Then obviously tell her never to give her name and probably don\'t upload things like that through the snapchat team.'
###### b'I\'m glad Alyssa is sharp instead of going "huh?.. Um do I know you?" instead she went full on "call the police I\'ve never seen him before" smart girl. Kudos to you too, keeping all the kids safe.'
###### b'That is one of the most terrifying things I\xe2\x80\x99ve read as a mother to an almost 16yr old daughter that is on Social Media way too much. Thanks for posting your story. Those are the things parents need to read for a quick scare, to get them to be more vigilant with their children and what they do on social media.'
###### b'Your \xe2\x80\x9cand a grumpy old person answered" had me chuckling. \n\nBut seriously, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that not only did you listen to your instincts, but that they were so spot on, and that no one was hurt!!! That sounds so horrifying.'
###### b'As relieving as the outcome of this is, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think the police turning on their sirens was pretty counterproductive'
###### b"so i have a relative who is actually named alyssa, and when she was 16, she had a social media stalker. he like, tattooed her name on him, and would send her messages all the time. she'd block him and he'd just make a new account and keep messaging her. \n\nshe eventually called the police and im not really sure what came of it as we aren't close, but it was a wild story"
###### b"On the other hand, you're the best glammother, EVER!"
###### b'Spotter for human trafficking perhaps? Did you say someone else was driving that car he got in to? If so this is some sort of organized operation'
###### b'why would the police roll up with sirens going, do they actively not want to catch these criminals. i know, lets give them a head start and the direction we are coming from. super job.'
###### b"Damn that's weird 0.0"

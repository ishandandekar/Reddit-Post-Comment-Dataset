## Had an incredibly frightening experience last night and wanted to know if anyone here has ever had a similar encounter
#### b'So last night, I was at a classmates house working on a group project we have due tomorrow. I live in an apartment in the town where our university is located and my classmate lives at his parents house which is in the foothills just outside of town. In order to get to the house, you have to drive along a relatively secluded and narrow two-lane road for about 5-6 miles. We started working on the project at about 6 pm and I ended up hanging around for a while after we had finished our working. So I left his house pretty late at about 11 and started down the road back towards town. I didn\'t realize how tough it would be to navigate the road at night; there were no streetlights and the road was unkept and riddled with potholes. On top of this, I had no cell service so I had to drive very slowly to make sure I didn\'t blow out one of my tires since I had used my spare a couple of weeks back.\n\nI figure I was about 3 miles from the house when I rounded a tight corner and saw a pickup truck with a camper shell parked diagonally across the road. The manner in which it was parked completely impeded my path and I couldn\'t drive around it because there was a gully on both sides of the road. The only way for me to go at this point was backward, where there was a pulloff that I could use to turn my car around. At first I couldn\'t see inside the cab, but when I turned on my high beams I saw that there was a man slouched over in the drivers seat, his head resting against the steering wheel as if he had been knocked out after a bad accident. I immediately sensed something was wrong, the way his car had just "coincidentally" come to rest in a position that totally blocked the road was a big red flag for me. I had heard stories of people playing dead in the road as a way to lure unsuspecting people out of their cars so they could rob them.\n\nI decided "fuck this shit" and elected to go back to my classmates house and explain what was going on. I threw the car into reverse and kept my eyes darting back and forth between my rearview and the truck. I looked and saw that I was almost to the pulloff where I could turn around. When I looked back, my heart skipped about five beats. The man who had been slouched over in the drivers seat was now walking at my car at a hurried pace while a few other men jumped out of the camper shell and started moving towards me as well. I panicked and accelerated backwards into the pulloff, which messed up the undercarriage of my car pretty bad. As I put it into drive the guy was already at my passenger side door tugging on the handle which, thank the lord, was locked. I only caught a brief glimpse of him but his face appeared to be scabbed and leathery, definitely a meth head or some sort of drug abuser. I sped away and didn\'t slow down at all until I reached the house, constantly checking my rearview to see if they were following. Thankfully they didn\'t tail me, and when I reached the house I explained what had happened to my classmate and we called the cops. I was grateful that my buddies parents were kind enough to let me stay the night.\n\nThey didn\'t find anyone on the road matching the description but I filed an incident report and they told me they would be on the lookout for similar vehicles and suspicious activity. But holy shit, I\'m still so shook up over it. I keep getting the same adrenaline rush I got when I saw the guy charging me whenever I think about it. Please share similar experiences you\'ve had, as I would appreciate a good read or a good discussion to help clear my headspace! '

###### b'Never forget your vehicle is a weapon.  (Military training)\n'
###### b"I've heard tons and tons of stories like this from people I know in real life and a lot of them on Reddit. I really suggest you go out and get yourself a dash cam that records in HD and is fairly good in low light conditions they range anywhere from like $50 to a couple of hundred. It's worth the investment if you can afford it."
###### b"My experience was not even close to as scary as yours but I had an experience where I forgot to lock my door. A few years ago I was driving out of my neighborhood where I came upon a guy who motioned for me to roll down my window. It looked like he was looking for something so I assumed he maybe had lost his dog. Because I'm a trusting jackass, I pull up and roll down my window enough to speak to him. He introduces himself, asks my name, and then he opens the door and gets in my car and locks the door. I immediately noted that he had developmental delays. I ask him to please get out of the car and he tells me no. It felt like ice running in my veins because he was a lot taller and a lot heavier than me. I ask him again and tell him that I need to leave. He then gets out of the car. I locked the door, rolled up the window, and sped the fuck out of there. He obviously didn't want to hurt me but it scared me how stupid and trusting I had been in the moment. "
###### b"I heard many variations of this. One being a man laying in the road like he had been in a hit and run or something, with other men hiding in the bushes. Another is a baby car seat in the road with a blanket over it. Another is a fake cop car trying to get you to pull over in a deserted spot for no reason. I read a story here a while ago where a woman said she driving late at night, a cop car approached her and waved her to pull over even though she wasn't doing anything wrong. She decided to keep driving until she came to a populated gas station to pull into. Cop car sped off so she called them to find out why she had been asked to pull over but they told her they didn't have any units out that night. So scary that these things actually happen."
###### b"When I was young I had a friend whose family lived in a wealthy area that was very sparsely populated. Large houses all far apart. One night, He and I with 2 other friends were partying at his house drinking and smoking. We were all about 17 at the time. We decided to make a late night run to Don's for munchies around 1-2AM.  (yes i know very irresponsible, I have not done this since I was a teen and absolutely do not condone this behavior)\n\nI was driving and we were cruising down a state highway with no street lights at about 65-70mph. We are all laughing, having a good time when a car with its high beams on speeds up close to my bumper seemingly out of nowhere. Then the headlights completely shut off. My heart absolutely sank, but no one else seemed to notice it. I was telling them what I had just seen in my rear view when the headlights turned back on reappearing in my mirror. The car was now about 40 yards behind me. The car sped up to my bumper again and the headlights suddenly turned off again. I am shitting bricks at this point, my teeth clenching, fists gripping the steering wheel incredibly tightly. I was too afraid to call the police since we were all underage and intoxicated. A few seconds later the car's headlights flicked on again. This time as the car started speeding towards my back bumper it swerved hard towards the median, then jerked back towards the breakdown lane and flipped over multiple times. We all started freaking out, I pulled off the next exit and we headed straight back to my friends house without calling the police.\n\nI still to this day am freaked out by this incident because I may have left someone dead in the road without call for help and simply because of how strange and mysterious it was. Was the driver trying to mess with me and accidentally flipped? Was it an attempted suicide by car? Was the driver drunk/on drugs? What was going on in that vehicle? I'm not friends with anyone from that group anymore but while I still was none of us ever talked about it again..."
###### b'Always try 911 on your phone regardless of service. Your phone carrier might not provide service but another might have coverage and 911 calls supercede carrier limitations.\n\nEdit spelling cuz you know mobile and I suck at it in general. '
###### b'I had a similar experience and I am a man. I was taking a break from truck driving and driving Uber around my area. I had dropped off a fare late at night in a community off of a main road. There was an exit that was surrounded by heavy landscaping plants. When I was leaving and got to the exit, there was an SUV parked almost blocking the road with its emergency flashers on. There was someone slumped over the wheel. I had just enough room to pull up beside the car and I rolled down my window and shouted to the person if he was alright. \n\nWell this looked to be a guy in his 20s. When I asked him if he was alright, he lifted his head and said he thought he was having a heart attack. I had my phone in my hand and just dialed 911. He heard me talking to 911 and shouted \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t need them, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling better\xe2\x80\x9d and threw his car into gear and took off. \n\nI pulled out in the main road because I did not want to hang around where all that heavy foliage was in case someone was hiding in there. I was still in the line with 911 and they took it very seriously. I gave them a description of the SUV. I did not get his tag when he left because his lights were off. I was told they were going to send a bunch of patrol cars to the area but I figured he was long gone. \n\nIn thinking about it though, I always wondered what he thought I was going to do when he said he was having a heart attack but call 911. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a doctor. What else is someone going to do in that situation. '
###### b'OMG! My heart skipped some beats just reading this. That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible that you had to experience something so horrifying. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you are ok. I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of freaked out now. '
###### b'Holy shit. \n\nI had a similar experience with some random guy trying to open my passenger door. I walked out of walmart one afternoon and walk over to my car. I hop in and hop on spotify to find something to listen to before I leave. I turn my car on while I grab my phone. Now this Walmart is located in a busy shopping center that also has a few bus stops at one location. Well, this dude gets off the bus which is in front of me, he gets off and  immediately just staring at me. When I looked up, we made eye contact, he started smiling, walking to my car like we were friends and he hadn\'t seen me in a long time, mind you, I have no idea who the fuck this guy is. He walks over to my truck, I lock my truck and get ready to back out of my parking spot, and he tries to open my passenger door as I\'m backing out and he\'s saying "Hey where you going? How you been?" While STILL trying to open my door. At this point, I pulled out my phone and said IM CALLING THE COPS!  He took off running. Bet damn right I made a report. Fuck that guy, it was scary af. \n\n\nI\'m so sorry OP, but you are so smart to avoid that situation!'
###### b'I live at the bottom of some foothills, so I could easily envision this in my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye and it\xe2\x80\x99s super freaky!  You really do feel so isolated and vulnerable driving up there.'
###### b'I was driving with a friend between two small towns in the countryside and found myself upon along a road between two fields and, quite cramped, only room for one car so I was driving quite slowly and there was this guy stood in the road who started waving his arms around shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! Please stop!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMy friend spent some years growing up in South America and has some bad experiences on the road and generally has a nervous disposition and she started to get extremely anxious, saying that he was going to kill us.\n\nSuffice to say, this did little for my nerves.\n\nI lock my door and put the window down a crack and ask what he wants from a distance but as he sees I\xe2\x80\x99m stopping he speeds up toward me at which point my friend screams \xe2\x80\x9cThere are people in the bushes just drive!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd drive I do. The guy tries to dive in front of my car, I do my best to avoid him without plowing into the hedgerow and I wing him with my headlight, he falls on to the floor and I carry on. It\xe2\x80\x99s pitch black in my rear view mirror so I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything else.\n\nI get her to call the police immediately (Which she was hesitant to do as she was overstaying her tourist visa at the time) as I continue to drive to explain what happened, the police don\xe2\x80\x99t find anyone. And they come to our hotel to take a statement from me too because I told them that I hit someone. In any case this situation would readily fall under my country\xe2\x80\x99s self defence laws as I apprehended the immediate threat of physical violence and any injuries he sustained by diving on to my car were outside of my control which breaks the chain of causation.\n\nYears after the fact however, she messages me about the incident. And she told me that upon reflection she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think she really did see anyone at the side of the road, that her mind was playing tricks on her and she just freaked out about it and said it because she was afraid. This makes me sick because I very well may have hit and abandoned a man who genuinely needed help, but in any case he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the police or hospital nor did I hear back from the police about the incident so who knows? Still. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to her since as I feel very conflicted over the whole ordeal.'
###### b"This reads like a horror film. I had to double check what sub this was from. Glad you're okay, I can't imagine I'd have been as collected and functional"
###### b'Hmmm I\xe2\x80\x99ve had sort of a similar experience. I was in downtown Dallas on a Saturday night. I was planning on staying at a hotel with my boyfriend but we decided not to. We were driving in separate cars and were headed back to my house. I was following him but lost him at a light. My phones GPS wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working so I was relying on memory to get back to the highway. Dallas is very nice in some areas and not so much in others. So I wound up in a sketchy area. I was about to get on the highway but got stuck at the light before merging onto it. As I pulled up to the light I immediately had a bad feeling so I slowed down. There was a car parked diagonally and blocking the intersection. All of the car doors were open wide and three people were standing outside of the car. At first I thought it was an accident but the only other car there was just waiting at the light. I left a lot of space between myself and the other car waiting for the green light. There was a woman and two men standing in the intersection. The woman had headphones in and was dancing around. The two men were just looking around. I thought it was weird that all four doors were open but there were only three people. For some reason the lady became agitated and started screaming at the people in front of me. She went up to their car and started hitting the hood and the drivers window. The people in the car were freaking out and took a left turn even though the light was red. Then the lady focused on my car and started yelling at me \xe2\x80\x9cCOME ON, WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING DOING?PULL UP YOUR CAR BITCH.\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any closer and took the fastest left turn when the light turned green a few seconds afterwards. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they were on drugs but I knew they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have good intentions. My experience wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as creepy as yours but I could relate to an extent! \n\nEdit: typo '
###### b'Shit. Fucking drug addicts are like thinking zombies.'
###### b"My incident isn't nearly as scary as yours, but it still shook me up a bit.  I play music on the weekends, and sometimes I don't get back into town until very late.  One Friday night a few years ago, I didn't get back until around 3, and I needed to deposit the cash I'd earned to cover a bill in the morning.  The bank I use has the night deposit slot between the outside wall and one of the service lanes with the little pneumatic tube, so you're kinda boxed in when you use it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I pulled up to the deposit slot and started to get out, a car pulled up right behind me.  I thought it was kind odd, someone else needing the night deposit box at the same time at 3 am, but I dismissed it as a funny coincidence and went on with the deposit.  But then, headlights came on in front of me; there was a car in the parking lot about 20 feet ahead that I hadn't noticed before.  Again, I thought it was just a weird coincidence, until the car started slowly pulling up in front of me.  That's when alarm bells FINALLY started going off.  I forgot all about the deposit, hopped into my car and sped out through a small gap between the car and the bank wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still don't know if they were really trying to box me in to rob me or whatever, or if it was just my tired brain making me paranoid, but I'm glad I didn't stay to find out."

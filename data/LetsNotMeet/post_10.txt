## Florida woman crawled out of my hotel mirror to rob me
#### b'This past Monday my coworkers and I returned to our hotel from a day of work out in the field.  Rebecca and I walked to our rooms and as we stood outside of our rooms, I opened mine and I saw someone in the bathroom. I said, \xe2\x80\x9chello\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d  Nobody answered.  My first instinct was that it was a cleaning lady in there for some reason - and then I saw MY bag with MY clothes in her hands. \n\nI said to my coworker, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a woman in my room.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I asked the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing with my stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d It gets a little fuzzy here because I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember everything I said and what she said, but she kept mumbling about how her key still worked... how it still worked and that\xe2\x80\x99s how she got in.\n\nI was in shock and she was obviously very flustered having been caught mid robbery.  She dropped my bags and fumbled around with her purse and a white plastic bag.  By this time my coworker was behind me watching all the insanity unfold.  This woman was scrambling and walking towards the door and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in the bag?\xe2\x80\x9d thinking it is probably my stuff and so she said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s just my things, it\xe2\x80\x99s just my things, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you,\xe2\x80\x9d and so she did.  I looked and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything of mine and so since I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously in shock at this time, I let her leave. \n\nI went into my room and it\xe2\x80\x99s been ransacked.  I did a quick look around to see if anything had been taken.  All of my electronics were still there. Then I went into the bathroom and I saw my underwear, my bikini, and my clothes shoved into my own bags randomly. Even my passport was shoved in there!!  Then I looked on the counter and I saw that she got into my medication. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what was going through my head at the moment other than I wanted it back, so I ran out the door to go find her. I ran to the laundry room downstairs and out to the sides of the hotel and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her. I realized I was never going to find her, so my coworker and I went down to the lobby to tell them what happened and then we called the police. \n\nWe went back up to my room to wait and I noticed that there is a metal bat on my bed a little larger than one of those novelty wooden bats you can get at a baseball game but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a flashlight on the end. She must\xe2\x80\x99ve left it behind in her hurry. She also left behind a necklace that must\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen out of her bag when she was scrambling with mine.\n\nI was mostly freaking out at this point because I thought that she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten away with my medication that I need. The police got there and took our statements and looked around the room as well. One thing that I noticed was that there were bits of drywall in the sink and I pointed that out to the cops but none of us really knew where it came from.  We started looking at the door and the windows to see if she pried her way in somehow but there was nothing.  So we kind of just went with the idea that she had a spare key or something, even though the hotel front desk was adamant that there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that could be. \n\nThe officer that came brought two more officers as back up because they thought the woman might still be in the vicinity. But after our statements were taken, there was nothing else they could really do so they left. I sat down to finally make some calls to tell people, and as I\xe2\x80\x99m on the phone, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about the drywall in the sink and it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to me. So I\xe2\x80\x99m on the phone and looking at the drywall and the mirror on the wall right above it\xe2\x80\xa6.. and then it hit me... \n\nI got my coworker and asked her to help me pull at this mirror on the wall. And we took the mirror down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a hole there just big enough for a desperate junkie to squeeze through. I asked Brian and Rebecca if I should call the cops again to let them know that I found this and my boss said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s still two cop cars in the parking lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo I went down to tell them and the female cop kinda rolled her eyes, but the young guy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come check it out.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nThey both came back up, looked in the hole, and found\xe2\x80\xa6 A pillow, blankets, cigarettes, clothes, toothbrushes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.\n \nThis woman had been LIVING IN THE WALL BEHIND MY MIRROR for God knows how long!!  She had access to me and my room at all times!! (I know it might be hard to picture - there was a crawlspace about 2 feet wide in between the two rows of rooms.) One of the officers called the original officer to come back and take pictures of this.  She explained to him what\xe2\x80\x99s going on and all I hear over the radio is \xe2\x80\x9cNo fucking way!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe comes back, takes pictures, and is just as mind blown as the rest of us.\n\nObviously we packed up and left immediately.\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s even crazier is she has probably been there a long time. The last time we stayed at this hotel I would randomly smell cigarette smoke and I assumed someone was smoking in their bathroom and it was traveling through the vents. But nope a junkie was smoking just on the other side of my mirror! \n\nShe had access to other rooms too. The holes in the walls were from a renovation and the hotel hadn\xe2\x80\x99t properly patched and just covered up with mirrors. She could have been hanging out in people\xe2\x80\x99s rooms when they were gone.\n\nAnyway this was insane and I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a little time off.\n\nPosting from mobile so sorry if the formatting is off. \n\n[photo of the hole](https://imgur.com/gallery/nDiovlr) \n\n'

###### b"I'll never be able to sleep in a hotel room again without first checking the mirrors. Thanks OP"
###### b'That is beyond crazy...i actually shuddered reading this. Can\'t help but think the hotel must have had a history of guests with "unexplained" stolen items. Surely this wasn\'t her first rodeo. '
###### b'This is the single most insane thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever read. OP, thanks to you I\xe2\x80\x99m checking every hotel mirror I stay in.\n\nAlso how did she figure this out? Are they doing to find a literal pile of shit in the walls? How did she get in the first time? Have things been missing?\n\nWHAT THE FUCK. '
###### b"Guys, for a second just try to visualise her crawling out of the mirror. \nIt's 12:00 am here and I was going to bed. Thanks op. \n"

###### b'>Florida woman...\n\nSay no more. '
###### b'Now THIS is an incredible story! Sorry you experienced it, but you did a great job describing it.'
###### b'Holy crap. \n\n\\*adds new fear to already lengthy list of fears\\*'
###### b'Reminds me of the movie Looking glass with nick cage. He buys a motel does some renovations and finds out he can see ppl through a two way mirror in one room. Crazy story for you to experience '
###### b'She should have given you a courtesy call a week in advance, warning you of when she was going to crawl out of the mirror. But better the mirror than, say, the TV.. i suppose. '
###### b'When I read the title I thought it was a r/nosleep post! Jesus that is frightening! Obviously she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting you back. '
###### b'r/Floridaman'
###### b'Longfourm article about Ruthie Mae McCoy who was murdered by somebody who came through her bathroom cabinet. Her story is said to have inspired the 90s horror Candyman. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m glad your ok OP this gave me genuine shivers.\n\n\nhttps://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/they-came-in-through-the-bathroom-mirror/Content?oid=871084'

###### b'I also thought that I was reading a r/nosleep story by mistake \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re ok! She could have come into your room at night and hurt you. I\xe2\x80\x99d call the local news station and tell them your story. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to ensure that the hotel will fix the problem by blocking up all the holes. You\xe2\x80\x99d think they\xe2\x80\x99d notice a junkie roaming the halls on the security cameras. Unless they don\xe2\x80\x99t work...\n\nThe bat thing sounds like a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s bat for knocking out large fish so they don\xe2\x80\x99t cause mayhem in the boat. I actually found one with a flashlight. [fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s bat](https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/iprotec-bat-light-led-flashlight) She could have killed you with one of those. '

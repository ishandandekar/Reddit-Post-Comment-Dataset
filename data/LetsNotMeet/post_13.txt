## The one day I woke up late may have saved my life.
#### b'I\'ve told this story in other places, on other accounts before, but it bears repeating. \n \nOne day, when I was an elementary schooler (I think probably 3rd or 4th grade), I was awoken by my mom in a rush. She had overslept, and since she always woke me up in the morning, this meant that I too overslept and now there was just no way I was gonna be ready for school early enough to get on the school bus. \n \nIIRC, school started at 8 AM, and my bus pickup time was 7 AM, but it was already like 6:40 or something, and I was still in my pajamas and hadn\'t even had breakfast yet. So mom decided that today, we would just tell the bus driver to go on ahead and she would take me to school, which would give me plenty of time to get ready. \n \nSo I\'m sitting there at the dining room table eating breakfast, still in my pajamas, and it\'s now about 6:50. We hear the bus pull up, about 10 minutes earlier than usual. My mom peeks her head out of the door, into the foggy morning and waves the bus on. She closes the door and comes back inside, but the bus doesn\'t pull away. \n \nThere\'s a knock at the door, and mom opens it to find a man in a bus driver uniform. He explains that he\'s a substitute driver, because the regular driver called in sick. He says he knows he\'s a few minutes early, since he wanted to get an early start on the route since he didn\'t know it well. Mom explains to him that she was gonna take me to school since we woke up late. He gets visibly upset, and says that he can wait a few minutes since he\'s already running ahead of schedule. My mom insists that no, I won\'t be ready to go in a few minutes, and tells him to go on ahead. He seemed angry about this, but turned around and got back in the bus and left. \n \nI return to eating my breakfast, and still don\'t have my school clothes on at this point. But at 7:00 AM sharp, another bus pulls up to my house. Mom thinks this is weird and goes outside to talk to them. She comes back inside looking terrified, but doesn\'t really say anything about it and tells me to finish getting ready for school. At the time, I didn\'t know what happened, but mom would end up telling me a few years later. \n \nWhen she went to this second bus, she found that it was being driven by my regular bus driver, and it was full of all the other kids that are usually on the route (the other bus was empty, by the way). Mom asks the driver about the substitute driver and about him calling in sick. "I never called in sick. There is no substitute driver on my route." he says.\n \nThe driver immediately called dispatch in a panic, and told my mom to go inside and call the police (which she did, without me knowing) and report this incident. There was absolutely no one doing my driver\'s route that day. Whoever this was, was most likely a kidnapper who had targeted me. \n \nI never heard anything about it again. Not even if someone else had ended up being picked up by this mysterious fake bus driver. But chances are, had I gotten on that bus, I would have never made it to school, or back home. And if mom hadn\'t overslept on that specific day, I would have been on that bus. '

###### b'THIS IS TERRIFYING. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re okay and luck smiled on your family that day. '
###### b'This is super creepy for a whole lot of reasons. It makes me glad my elementary school and 1 bus driver, who all the kids called Quarter (not sure if that was his legal name or not), who was the only one who drove the bus. No Quarter, no bus. '
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m just confused where he got a bus and a uniform. '
###### b'That is horrific, he prepared himself as far as getting a uniform and a bus, and seemingly targeting one particular person, and was smart enough to never return. I wonder if he went on to look for another victims elsewhere.'
###### b"Did anything ever come from this? Did they catch the guy? I'm very curious. So scary :-("
###### b'Oh yikes I got goosebumps the moment the second bus showed up \xf0\x9f\x98\xa8\xf0\x9f\x98\xa8'
###### b"This is scary! I send my son on the bus every morning by himself. I can't actually walk to the bus stop with him because I have a 3 month old I can't leave alone. But the bus stop is only across the street, just not visible from my apartment window. I need to have a talk with him about bus safety now. "
###### b'This made me shiver. I hope that "substitute driver" didn\'t abduct any other kid. By the looks of it, seems that he had planned it for a long time, stalks and watches you perhaps ?\nStarting to think that some for reason a guardian angel let your mom overslept to avoid this very unfortunate event. heck, I don\'t even know if angels really exist, but still. '
###### b'Hold up, so this guy bought both a uniform and a *bus* to try to get one kid? I feel like some exposition is missing here from the story.  '
###### b'A similar experience happened to my mom when she was a kid! Except it was her regular bus driver. He had picked up all of the kids on their route as usual except he didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop them off at school until at least an hour and half later. The principal was calling parents of the absent children asking why they were absent and my grandmother said she told the principal that she saw my mom get on the bus. So of course all the parents start panicking because no one knows where the bus was. My mom had told me that the driver just pulled over on a random street and sat there in the bus with them for over an hour. Eventually, he ended up dropping them off at school but to this day nobody knows what his intentions were and why he decided that particular day to stall the drop off. crazy to think what could have happened! '
###### b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of effort to go to kidnap a particular kid! He must have been obsessed. I wonder if your mum had seen him around before like watching you. '
###### b'Even if your mum hadn\xe2\x80\x99t have woken up late, I reckon she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let you on the bus. If it was usually meant to be full of kids but it was empty, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she would have clocked on before it was too late. Hopefully!'
###### b'This should be in the news somewhere, if real. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never stolen a bus, nor been a bus driver, but I have the feeling the keys aren\xe2\x80\x99t just left laying under a floorboard mat. To steal a bus would likely take some expert-level execution, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know many kidnappers who\xe2\x80\x99d risk exposure in literally the largest fucking automobile on the road, just to steal one kid. \n\nSorry. But nah. '
###### b"You should call that police dept and see if there are any records of followup on your mom's phone call !"
###### b'Not exactly the same, but the beginning of the school year there were reports of an unmarked bus in a neighborhood trying to pick up kids near me. Turns out it was a charter school in the area, and they had just gotten the bus.. luckily for here it turned out to be nothing. \n\nBut very scary op, was your bus marked by your district,  cause either someone slipped up and did confess to it, or someone went through a lot of work to convince people it was an actual bus. Do bus drivers typically come to the door? '

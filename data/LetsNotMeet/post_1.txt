## My brother saw a ghost as a kid. Two decades later, I realized what he actually saw.
#### b'I was about 7 years old; my brother about 10. It was well past our bedtime when our mom woke up off the couch to put us to bed. Our dad worked construction out of town back then, so it was often just us three at the house for weeks at a time. Up the stairs and to the immediate right was our parents\' bedroom. Going left put you in the middle of a hallway. Taking another left down that hallway led to my brother\'s room. The opposite end was my room which was also across the hall from our upstairs bathroom. At either end of the hallway are windowed doors we always kept locked and rarely used. The door on my end led to a balcony overlooking our front yard, and the door on my brother\'s end opened to our back porch (the house kinda leans into a small hill).\n\nMy brother and mom both had a habit of waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. I only knew this because I was always a light sleeper and they just couldn\'t help flushing with the door wide open. This night, however, my brother stopped on his way to his room and came back towards the bathroom, "I\'m gonna try to pee before I go to bed. The past few nights I\'ve been too afraid to walk to the bathroom. I keep seeing a man wearing stripes at the end of the hallway.". I don\'t know if my mom wrote it off as my brother telling ghost stories to try to scare me or if she was already half asleep and didn\'t catch it, but she didn\'t react at all to my brother\'s confession. I, on the other hand, was terrified by it. The fear of seeing a ghost like that at the end of the hallway or through the windows is the reason I started running from the stairs to my bedroom at night.\n\nYears later, when I was about 18, my mom and I were having a conversation in her car about a dog we had for a very short time when I was little. We were sharing stories about Max\'s tendency towards destroying my shoes and other unruly behaviors when my mom blurted out, "Do you remember that time I opened the front door for the cops and Max ran inside to the kitchen and started tearing open that big bag of dog food we had?". This really caught me by surprise, because in all the years I lived in that house we never once called the cops (gun owner family in a quiet, rural WV neighborhood, etc.). \n\nI asked her what she was talking about and she looked equally surprised as if she had just revealed something by accident. "Oh, that\'s right! I never told you because you were too young at the time. One night, I woke up hearing noises outside my window and when I looked I saw a man staring into my bedroom.". She went on to describe how turning on the lights caused him to take off running and how she grabbed my dad\'s pistol before calling the cops. "I can\'t remember all the details I gave them when they showed up... tall white male, wearing a striped shirt and jeans, short dark hair... something like that. They said it matched the description of a man they were looking for in the area. It turns out he had escaped from jail on a murder charge."\n\nNow, I know it sounds so obvious hearing those two stories back to back, but it wasn\'t until a few years ago, in my mid-twenties, that I pieced together that my brother had unknowingly warned us about a murderer who spent multiple nights casing our home.'

###### b'Wait was he IN your house?! Since your brother said he was at the end of the hallway, not in a window?'
###### b"I've been on reddit too long. I really thought you were going to tell us that your mom was cheating with the guy in stripes and your brother saw him in the house."
###### b"My dad likes to tell me this story a lot- but when I was about 4 or 5 years old for a couple nights I would run into my dads room crying about a man with glasses in the closet. He'd always come back to my room and when no one was there assume I was having nightmares. \n\nOne night, this same thing happened and as he was walking me back to my room, we heard a noise downstairs. My dad proceeded to grab his shot gun from his room and run downstairs, chasing a man with glasses into the yard and down the road. \n\nTurns out one of the neighbors sons was breaking into our house and hiding out in my room. Not sure what happened from there on out, but he never appeared again. Kinda freaky stuff to think about now looking back on it."
###### b'My heart started pounding piecing this together. Holy shit.'
###### b'Well, one of the few times you\'d hear noises in the night and think "Please be a ghost"'
###### b'Happy Halloween I guess...'
###### b'Shit this seriously spooked me. Holy crap lol'
###### b'Could you please make a diagram of the layout of this house? This is absolutely spooky, but I for some reason am caught up on the layout. Help a needy mind out!'
###### b'Umm why is this tagged funny? That\xe2\x80\x99s not funny. This one of the scarier posts on this subreddit. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad everything turned out ok and your family wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt. '
###### b'What happened to Max??'
###### b"An escaped murderer (alledged murderer) is big news. Have you researched this man? Try to learn what kind of twisted pig farmer was creeping around your house in the middle of these dangerously dark nights? I would Google the earth, fire, and wind out of this man. What's his name? How did he escape? How many poor bastards did this guy murder? Serial killer? Mass murder? Maybe he lost it on his wife or his business partner of twenty years for banging his wife. Is he in prison? What was his sentence? Any chance of a duplicated snowflake that this sick son of a bitch just might walk our honest, clean streets a free man again? \n\nYou should find out as much detail about this convict and his crimes fueled by absolute demon inspired depravity. Then you can share any of the information that you feel comfortable sharing with us. I am eager to learn more."
###### b'A+ title!! Why would this guy stick around for multiple days in the same location, and still be wearing his prison uniform though? That\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing you do when you escape prison- put on regular clothes to disguise yourself. And then you keep fucking moving. '
###### b'Ask your brother and update!'
###### b"The Federal Jail here in my hometown, Jefferson County (Beaumont, TX to be more specific) has had a huge problem with escapees. There's a twist though. Inmates had a routine where one would sneak out and run off to a location out in the countryside to pickup care packages that friends or family would leave for them. This ranged from home-cooked food, alcohol, tobacco, etc. Apparently a man who has lived near the Federal Jail made several complaints for more than 10 years about escapees using his land to make the runs. Something was finally done about it this year but to be honest I can respect those inmates for just wanting some normalcy AND for going back to serve their time. They know what they did."
###### b'Well fuck that! '

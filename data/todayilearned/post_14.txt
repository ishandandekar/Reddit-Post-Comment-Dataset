## TIL: Microsoft tried a 4-day workweek in Japan as part of a "Work Life Choice Challenge" by shutting down offices every Friday. Productivity, measured by sales per employee, increased by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year.

###### b'Did they keep it going?'
###### b'Japanese work culture in general tends to be very very focused on how long you\xe2\x80\x99re at work to the point where people basically just sit around doing nothing but since they\xe2\x80\x99re present it looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re very dedicated. It\xe2\x80\x99s absurd. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve really noticed that most of the bosses that have this rule where butts need to be in seats x amount of time or are against 4 day weeks, WFH etc are really old school and also terrible managers, they usually have nothing else to do besides make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re on task so to save their own jobs they need to implement these kinds of rules. So instead of having managers or directors that are strategists or high level thinkers what they have are babysitters.'
###### b'Employers need to ask themselves: Do I trust my employees to get the job done in an acceptable way delivering what I need them to be OR do I want to be in the "hall monitor" business keeping tabs on where they are and how much time they spend doing it?'
###### b'My company switched to 9/80 and getting a Friday off every two weeks has significantly changed my stress level.'
###### b'Is it 4/10s or 4/8s?'
###### b"The way these discussion tend to go:  \n\n\nBut we have to pay them more per hour.  \nYes, but they produce the same.   \nSo, why don't they produce more if we use 40 hours? People are just lazy, we need to lower their wages."
###### b'Work-life balance is one of the most pressing issues in society at the moment.\n\nPeople come from all over on the issue.\n\nSome people identify only through their work, some people despise work, and some people enjoy it.\n\nAltogether, the amount we do, and where we do it, matter.\n\nBut where do we strike a balance?'
###### b"You mean people are happier having more time off? That's nuts!"
###### b'In Japan no less, land of *karoshi* or death by overwork'
###### b'A large part was because they had fewer meetings'
###### b"Crazy how after it's been proven time and time again people are still stuck on the ridiculous idea of the 9-5."
###### b"I've always wondered whenever there's a change that benefits workers (work from home, shorter workweek, etc.) if the productivity gains are the result of the policy itself, or if it's more an issue of the workers responding to the change because they are viewed as unusual and they need to perform to keep those benefits. Would the same gains be maintained if these changes become viewed as the standard, instead of something that might have to be earned?"
###### b"Isn't Japan also big on staying late for no reason and just appearing to work?"

###### b'Before Covid my job was 6 straight days on and 2 days off. Toxic work environment and a lot of fatigue by the time you reached the 6th day. When Covid happened they separated the employees into two groups and would rotate 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. They also modified the scheduling so instead of 6 days on and 2 off it was mixed up like 4 days working and then 2 days off.  So in 2 weeks, you maybe worked like 9-10 days and then had your 14 days off.\n\nWAYY BETTER. Better work productivity. Better staff attitude. Less drama. Less toxic work environment (because people had time for their own lives instead of coworkers being their lives). And of course better work-life balance and happier/relaxed staff. I left the job last year but they went back to the normal schedule about 3 months ago (my friend still works there).\n\nEveryone wants to leave again and it\xe2\x80\x99s getting toxic all over again lol. Seriously I know this is fantasy talk. But 4 days working and 6 hour days is perfect imo. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spend 1/3 of your day at a job. And 3 days of relaxing and being with your ACTUAL family is better. \n\nSeriously, it\xe2\x80\x99s like Daylight Savings time shifts. Studies show this isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for people yet society refuses to change it.'

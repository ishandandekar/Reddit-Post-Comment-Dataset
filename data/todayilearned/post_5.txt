## TIL that in 1916 there was a proposed Amendment to the US Constitution that would put all acts of war to a national vote, and anyone voting yes would have to register as a volunteer for service in the United States Army.
#### b''

###### b'Tis merely a skirmish. No vote needed. '
###### b"The thing is there's been over 11,000 proposed changes to the Constitution since it's been around.  Only 17 of these have been passed, not including the original 10.  Plus if this did pass Congress it would still have a long way for it to become law, either 2/3 or 3/4 of states need to pass it as well (don't remember the number off the top of my head).  The way the Constitution is set up is so that there can be no radical changes to our country.  I don't believe that if this did pass it would have meet the other requirements as well."
###### b'This became known as the Ludlow Amendment after Representative Louis Ludlow (D-Indiana) introduced the amendment several times around WWII, the proposal did not apply if the US was attacked first. Congressman Ludlow stated:\n\n*The amendment would do more to keep American boys out of slaughter pens in foreign countries than any other measure that could be passed. It is based on the philosophy that those who have to suffer and, if need be, to die and to bear the awful burdens and griefs of war shall have something to say as to whether war shall be declared.*\n\n*If the United States had such an anti-war provision in its Constitution, other countries would follow our example, and I believe wars would be brought to an end.*\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Amendment)'
###### b'"Forward he cried, from the rear, as the front rank died." Us and Them-*Pink Floyd*'
###### b'Does this mean older people would have no say?'
###### b'As Otto Von Bismark pointed out, the U.S. was a blessed nation... surrounded by weak neighbors to the North and South, and surrounded to the East and West by fish.'
###### b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of proposed amendments and most of them fail. Fun fact, there has been 11,327 proposed amendments and only 27 have been approved by congress and ratified by states since 1789. Ten of those being the Bill of Rights in one shot.'
###### b'US has secret ballots.  How would they know who voted yes?'
###### b'>While the proposal was supported by around 75 percent of Americans at the time, according to polling, it failed in a congressional vote.\n\nDemocracy at its finest '
###### b"I'm sure many people in the 40's didn't want to fight the Nazi's or Imperial Japanese"
###### b'And then they realized their war club sucked and no one would actually volunteer, so they just made it a requirement for ~~everyone~~ men aged 21-30 to sign up for potential selection. '
###### b'Sure would make things interesting. I come from an area that was always very much for conflict "Murica!!" But I was also one of 5 people to graduate HS and join the military and the only one in my family (of age in late 90s) to join. Yet for the past 20 odd years I go back and I see all this support for war in Syria, Korea, Iran... Nobody seem to want to go through basic and make the trip to do it...'
###### b'They should do this for abortion restrictions. You want to ban abortions? Vote yes and you are put on a national registry to adopt the child a woman is forced to have. '
###### b'No one declares war anymore anyways, thats sooooo early 20th century.'
###### b'What are some other interesting proposed Amendments?'

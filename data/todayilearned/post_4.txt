## TIL a fan drove three hours to deliver rapper, Boozie Badazz, a much needed dosage of insulin. She refused to accept payment and instead asked for just a photo. On her way home she stopped at a store, bought a scratch off ticket, and won $10,000.

###### b'The only time a shot of insulin will *ADD* 10k to your bank account'
###### b"What an awesome coincidence. It's nice when people do things without expectation of reward."
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m old enough to still call him Lil Boosie'
###### b'\xe2\x80\x9cI slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n- Rabindranath Tagore'
###### b"[Why ya'll calling him Boozie, its Boosie](https://i.imgur.com/L7efAs4.gif)"
###### b"What I don't understand is why would he have to wait (more than?) three hours to get some insulin. Couldn't someone have gone to a pharmacy and bought some in much less time?"
###### b'Nice. He raps about selling drugs on my street. He also buys a crap ton of toys every year for the children of Baton Rouge.'
###### b'My name is Earl'
###### b"Damn that's beautiful"
###### b"Before Walmart came out with the (lower quality) generic insulin, it could be frustratingly hard to get your hands on insulin. Once your script is out, you're out of luck. As if you have to prove you haven't lost diabetes somehow.   \n\nWhile the Walmart insulin is harder on your system and shouldn't be used long term if you can avoid it, it's s nice safety net. Better than just letting yourself end up in the ER while you try to sort out issues with your doctor, pharmacy, or insurance (I've had several problems with all 3 over the years leading to delays.)"
###### b"This was during the start of covid-19 when everybody ran out of everything he couldn't get his insulin just cause your rich dont mean u can go without"
###### b'welcome to the mind of a maniac'
###### b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason insulin needs to be remotely expensive in the United States. I\xe2\x80\x99m a biochemist, but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even take a scientist to figure out that there\xe2\x80\x99s no rational basis for hiking insulin prices. It can be produced for near literally dirt cheap.'
###### b'this should be in /r/instantkarma'
###### b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t call an ambulance.\n\nEDIT: Some of you aren\xe2\x80\x99t grasping my point here. According to the article, he claimed an emergency and waited 3 hours for a stranger to give him something *he injected.* If I were to tell any of you I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there in 3 hours so you can put this in your body *because I\xe2\x80\x99m a fan of your work* would you take it? Or argue about the health care systems as a whole. Jesus Reddit, some of you guys just argue for sport.'

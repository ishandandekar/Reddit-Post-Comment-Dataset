## TIL The cast of FRIENDS each made $1M per episode in the final two seasons and now make $20M per year per cast member for reruns. The show still generates $1B/year for Warner Bros. All thanks to David Schwimmer encouraging the cast to negotiate as a team.
#### b''

###### b'$54,795 per day for acting you did 20 years ago. That\xe2\x80\x99s gotta feel nice.'
###### b'Imagine making $20 mil a year for something you finished doing almost 20 years ago, damn'
###### b'The second they signed the syndication deal, they were all worth $60 million.\n\nJust like when Jerry Seinfeld signed his syndication deal in the mid-90s, they handed him a check for $25 million dollars.'
###### b"Damn. David Schwimmer is a union hero and I didn't even know it"
###### b'Is it true that the cast of Fraiser were paid even more than that per episode?'
###### b"Between this and Seinfeld basically becoming a billionaire, I'd say they're some of the luckiest people on earth."
###### b'It makes me feel old when things that were commonly known at the time become a TIL now'
###### b"The salary demands of the cast caused the studio and network to look for ways to make more money off the show.  And one way they did this was to eliminate the opening title montage and song. \n\nEarly seasons had one. But by the end of the show's run, it was reduced to a cast shot and title card.  The resulting free time was sold as additional commercial space and earned substantial money.\n\nThis was then imitated by many other series and was one of the major causes of the demise of opening credit sequences on American TV."
###### b'This also applies to corporate America. I read an article recently where a VP of a larger bank stated that today more than ever, the younger generation is more inclined to speak to one another about their salaries. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t used to be the case. \n\nKnowing what those around you make only helps you in negotiation. Corporations would prefer you keep this a secret which tells you everything you need to know. Collective bargaining lifts everybody up.'
###### b'Wow, I apparently like David Schwimmer a lot more than Ross...'
###### b"Collective bargaining works, that's why they dont want you to have the option."
###### b'Everyone thinks David Schwimmer is a dick since he has no interest in a reunion and has generally avoided all talk about Friends since it ended but if I was getting 20M a year for doing absolutely nothing why in the hell would I ever want to work again unless I had a role I\xe2\x80\x99d been dying to play. Wealth outside of the public eye is much different than wealth with fame.'
###### b'Gunther makes $500,000 a year from royalties. All because he knew how to operate a cappuccino machine.'
###### b'Way to go Red Ross'
###### b'I love how in the 30 Rock reunion for quarantine, Liz asks Jack if NBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPeacock\xe2\x80\x9d will have Friends. Jack slaps her through the phone screen.'

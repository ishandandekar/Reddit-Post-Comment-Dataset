## TIL Costco's hot dog has remained $1.50 since it was first introduced in 1984. After the company president complained they were losing money on it, CEO Jim Sinegal put his foot down. "If you raise [the price of] the effing hot dog, I will kill you," Sinegal said.

Go to Costco once a month, spend $700 and get a hotdog and drink.\n\nEdit: This is officially my top comment. Which once again, is about Costco. \n\nI am a corporate shill.'

###### b"Love getting a hot dog, poutine and a coke for $6 after you drop $400 shopping on an empty stomach. Then you can drive home with a stomachache and question your purchase of a 5L jar of pickles that probably won't fit in the fridge."

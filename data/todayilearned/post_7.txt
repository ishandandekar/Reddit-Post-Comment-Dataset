## TIL actor Robert Pattinson dealt with an obsessed fan who had been camping outside his apartment by taking her out on a dinner date. "I just complained about everything in my life and she never came back."
#### b''

###### b'Mark Hamill did this on an episode of JUst Shoot Me\n\nDavid Spade/Finch was a super fan/stalker until Hamill turned it around and started following Finch and being annoying/complaining \n\nFinch stopped following Hamill'
###### b'Imagine how she feels reading this. Lol'
###### b'Every time I hear something about Robert Pattinson I end up liking him more and more.'

###### b'Nothing is more attractive than who you **imagine** someone is.'
###### b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hate that I am attracted to goats. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I just be normal?\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'The way he [frames it here](https://www.ctvnews.ca/robert-pattinson-took-devoted-fan-to-dinner-1.724416) makes the whole thing seem pretty sad:\n\n>"There was one day when I was just so chronically bored I said to her, \'Do you want to just go to dinner or something? No one else wants to hang out with me.\' Her parents had a restaurant; she took me there. I complained about everything in my life for about two hours, then she gave me the bill to pay and was never back outside my apartment ever again."'
###### b"You've got a stalker?\n\nNormal brain: file a police report \n\nBig brain: fake suicide, move away \n\nGalaxy brain: take them on a date"
###### b'Reminds me of when Daniel Radcliffe wore the same outfit for 6 months to avoid the paparazzi. \n\nAll new photos were \xe2\x80\x9cunusable\xe2\x80\x9d because it looked like everything was taken on the same day.'
###### b'TIL I date like Robert Pattinson.'

###### b"When i was like 19 or 20 I worked in a factory, and there was this much older woman who was low key obsessed with me to the point people teased me about it. Foreman thought it would be funny to make me work in close quarters with her for a whole 8 hour shift one night. It was a sit down job where we were both at the same small production table, and I decided the best course of action was just to rack off farts through the whole shift. You can't hear much in that setting but there's no hiding the odor. It worked like a charm, but I do feel kinda bad about now that I'm older."
###### b"Wait you mean women DON'T find it attractive when you're tired and depressed and complain about your life? \n\nOh fuck oh fuck oh fuck"
###### b'Obviously the better outcome... but 50/50 she wears your skin as a suit, dude.  So, good for you, I guess?'
###### b'I was prejudiced against Robert Pattinson because of twilight but every now and then I see quotes or stories about him that makes me think he is more interesting than I imagined. \n\nI really liked his take on method acting: \n"I always say about people doing method acting, you only ever see people doing method when they\xe2\x80\x99re playing an asshole. You never see someone just being lovely to everyone going, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m really deep in character\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d'

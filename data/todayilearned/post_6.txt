## TIL that the Animal Planet reality series ‘River Monsters’ ended because star Jeremy Wade was able to catch essentially every exceptionally large freshwater fish species on earth, leaving no remaining content for the show

###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised lol. The dude went out with a plan every every episode and executed that plan.'
###### b'Dude that Alaska crab show just catches the same thing over and over and over for 15yrs...'
###### b'I met Jeremy Wade about a decade ago. He was giving a lecture at the National Aquarium in Baltimore. I was a huge fan of the show, so of course I went. Afterwards he had a book signing, so I bought a copy. I was last in line, and he was chitchatting with each person who got an autograph. \n\nIn the quick conversation, I mentioned where I was originally from. Turns out, he\xe2\x80\x99d literally just been there to film about invasive carp on the river. I was due for a refill on my wine, and no one else was in line. He grabbed a water, and we just stood there shooting the breeze for a while before he had to go. \n\nReally cool dude'
###### b'He wept, for there were no more fish to conquer'
###### b"He's had two different series after River Monster, Dark Waters and the name of the other escapes me."
###### b"> every exceptionally large freshwater species **on earth**\n\nTime to send him to other planets then. He's caught all the river monsters here, now he's got the rest of the galaxy to conquer."
###### b'I saw every episode.  One of the true authentic tv shows. Exactly what we want. A goal. A process. And a result.'
###### b'70% of the show could be summarized as "but it was a catfish!"\n\n\nMan I miss it'
###### b'Every time he hurt himself "I\'ve permanently reduced the rotation of my shoulder"\n\nHis arm should have fallen off.'
###### b"They're not kidding. The guy straight up discovered a new species on that show once. He's really done it all.\n\nEDIT: For all the people curious as to what episode this was in, I can't remember. I saw the episode on TV back in like 2015. All I remember was that Wade was looking for some sort of mythological fish in South America (I think it was South America but I may be wrong). The episode ended with Jeremy Wade catching the fish and text appearing on the screen saying it was a completely unknown species."
###### b"I'm Jeremy Wade.\n\n\nThat line, in his voice, is so iconic."
###### b'Jeremy Wade is like the real "most interesting man in the world".\n\nWhat I loved about River Monsters was that it was essentially an Indiana Jones anthrophological show in the most old school way.\n\nBritish gentleman goes to the ends of the world to solve a mystery and in return learns of the ways of the exotic people that live there.\n\nJust genius and the way Jeremy writes everything down in his notebook. \n\nJeremy should just go on and do a search for mythological animals in general. No one cares if he actually catches any'
###### b"Dude, I love that show! It's why the arapaima is my favorite fish."
###### b'Be good, but never too good. Just ask The Curse of Oak Island guys, they have been milking that for 9 seasons now.'
###### b'Except loch Ness monster'

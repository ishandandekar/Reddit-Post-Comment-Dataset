## TIL After Col. Shaw died in battle, Confederates buried him in a mass grave as an insult for leading black soldiers. Union troops tried to recover his body, but his father sent a letter saying "We would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers."

###### b'Col. Shaw carried a famous sword when he led his men into his final battle and this was depicted in the film Glory (1989). Upon his death the extremely valuable sword was thought to have been stolen by a Confederate soldier and likely sold. However, it was discovered just last summer that one of his black soldiers was able to retrieve and return the sword to the Shaw family where it was placed in an attic for over 150 years.  The sword is now on display at the Massachusetts Historical Society.\n\n[Story](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/07/18/robert-gould-shaw-sword)'
###### b"Gen Patton wished to be buried with his men. He was buried in a Luxembourg American cemetery with several thousand soldiers. His grave is plain and relatively undistinguished. Here is a photo of [Patton's headstone shortly after his burial](https://www.skylighters.org/potd/images/10032003lg.jpg). \n\nIt has since been replaced with a stone headstone and moved a bit off to the side to accommodate all of the visitors."

###### b'Man, that was a hard one to fit inside 300 characters.\n\nFor a more verbose account: Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was the commanding officer of the 54th Massachusetts, the first all-black regiment in US history. On July 18, 1863, the regiment was ordered to spearhead an assault on Fort Wagner. Shaw was killed during the initial charge as he led his men into battle.\n\nWhile the assault was initially successful, Union forces were eventually pushed back and Confederate troops held on to the fort. Common practice at the time was for fallen officers to be given an honorable burial, regardless of the side they were on. However, as Shaw led the first all-black regiment, commanding Confederate General Johnson Hagood did not deem him worthy of that honor, stating\n\n>Had he been in command of white troops, I should have given him an honorable burial; as it is, I shall bury him in the common trench with the niggers that fell with him.\n\nUnion troops tried to recover his body and give him a proper burial, but were unsuccessful. Hearing of this, Shaw\'s father sent a letter to the regimental surgeon, stating:\n\n>We would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers....We can imagine no holier place than that in which he lies, among his brave and devoted followers, nor wish for him better company. \xe2\x80\x93 what a body-guard he has!\n\nAnd so, the act considered by General Hagood to be an insult, came to be seen as the greatest honor that could have been bestowed upon Shaw.\n\n----\n\nThe story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment is memorialized in the film "Glory", starring Matthew Broderick as Shaw.'
###### b'The Confederates thought it was an insult for Col. Shaw to be buried with black soldiers. \n\nShaw\xe2\x80\x99s family were hardcore abolitionist; leaving Col. Shaw with his men was his parents way of honoring him and his soldiers. \n\nI am 30; Col. Shaw was 25 years old when he died. Leading a direct,suicidal assult on a Confederate Fort, which was never captured during the war. I cannot imagine leading a regiment into battle at that age. His papers are in a university somewhere in Massachusetts. (I believe). The papers are worth the read. \n\nVery interesting guy. '

###### b'Glory was a great movie, which depicted this act at the very end. '
###### b"Honestly, it's weirdly satisfying he was buried with his soldiers- he'd have an insane family bond with them, and isn't that what we all want!? "
###### b'But we\xe2\x80\x99ll never be truly free\n\nUntil those in bondage have the same rights as you and me\n\nYou and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in\n\nOn a stallion with the first black battalion!'
###### b'Witness him.'
###### b'200,000 black soldiers joined the Union Army.   \n\nAround one out of six of Grant\xe2\x80\x99s men in the Eastern Theatre was black.\n\nMost of them were born into slavery, experienced all the cruelties of slavery, were freed by the war, then immediately joined the Union army to finish off slavery.  \n\nWe can glorify Shaw but remember that most of his men didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a childhood.   They had barely lived a day in real peace and freedom.   '
###### b'Give em hell 54th!'
###### b'I think they did him a service by burying him with his men. He probably would have liked that'

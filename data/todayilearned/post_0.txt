## TIL During an interview with Stephen Hawking, the camera operator yanked a cable causing an alarm and Hawking to slump forward. Worried they had killed him, everyone rushed over to find Hawking giggling at his own joke. The alarm was from an office computer losing power.

###### b'I swear, ALS robs you of a lot, but never your sense of humor. My aunt used to call her ALS-related tremors \xe2\x80\x9cthe ALS shimmies\xe2\x80\x9d and she would start dancing with it.'
###### b'If it counts for anything, I got to meet him at a dinner party once in the 90s, and the first thing he said to me was to apologize for his American accent. That guy had an amazing sense of humor.'
###### b">*Following Hawking's death in March 2018, BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh shared an anecdote of his first interview with the physics luminary at Cambridge University in 2004.*\n\n>*Seeking to adjust his lighting, the camera operator yanked a cable from a socket, at which point an alarm sounded and Hawking slumped forward as if unplugged from his life support. The anxious visitors rushed over to find Hawking very much alive and giddy at his joke \xe2\x80\x93 the alarm was simply over the office computer losing its power supply.*\n\nI can imagine for a moment, that camera man saw his life flash before his eyes."
###### b"If you can't find a reason to laugh about what life has handed to you, it is hard to be happy."
###### b'Steven Hawking was notorious for his sense of humor and pranks. The guy thought it was funny to drive his wheelchair at high speed and run over the toes of people at the university he worked for.\n\npart of me wonders if there is an alternate reality out there where he lived a normal life without sickness and became a quick witted comedian.'
###### b"His interview with John Oliver was hilarious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou once stated that there could be an infinite number of parallel universes, so theoretically there could be a universe where I\xe2\x80\x99m smarter than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And also a universe where you\xe2\x80\x99re funny.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nEdit: Because people keep asking for the link, [here's the video] (https://youtu.be/T8y5EXFMD4s)."
###### b"I mean you can't be one of the smartest people in the world without being able to think on your feet"
###### b'Stephen Hawking on contact with alien life:\n>\xe2\x80\x9dIf aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out well for the Native Americans.     \nWe only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet.\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'I love this....  Hawking offered a compelling argument against the notion of destiny: "I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road."'
###### b'If you can openly and so grandly make fun of your own death then you can do anything'
###### b'Wouldve been legendary if he also did the windows log off sound\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQk-XuyvRw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQk-XuyvRw)'
###### b"Couldn't we wirelessly charge Stephan Hawking? A dude so smart you think he woulda figured it out smh."
###### b'Did his speaker just say:\n\n`Ha Ha Ha. Ha Ha Ha. I am laughing`'
###### b'He could barely move his eyelids and cheek near the end of his life, but when he really laughed at something it actually showed on his face. The laughter, even though brief, brought back some control of the muscles. Laughter is very strong indeed, it seems.'
###### b"The same man that would absolutely deny the rumor that he ran over the toes of people he didn't like. He would then go on to say that if you dared repeat that rumor he'd run you over."

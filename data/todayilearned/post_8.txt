## TIL that millennial dads are spending 3 times as much times with their kids than their fathers spent with them. Back in 1982, 43% of fathers admitted they'd never changed a diaper. Today, that number is down to about 3%.

###### b'Haha! I made it a point to change my kids\' very first diapers at the hospital. Kinda symbolic thing, but I was like "I can do this!!" (Had no idea they poop road tar the first couple days though). \n\nFunny/sad story: when my oldest was about 5, we got recruited to join Indian Guides at her school. IN the US, it\'s a program started in the 50\'s to get dads spending more time with their kids (and really probably a way to monetize the camp sites in the winter). So three campouts a year, the dads got waaaaay into it - food, good cocktails around the fire when the kiddos crashed, horseback riding, canoes, hiking. Those campouts were bigger than christmas for our kids. So with 2 girls and a boy, and one "graduating" to the more hardcore camping group, I ended up doing 9 campouts every school year. \n\nSo we put flyers in the school papers, wanted to give every dad a shot at it. I got a call from a mom, "PLEASE call my husband, he HAS to do this!" I call the dude, explain what we\'re doing, love you to join us, your kids will love it.\n\n"That\'s ridiculous! You think I can pack in a whole weekend fooling around camping with my kids??" I basically thought (A) we probably don\'t want ya anyway, and (B) let\'s see what kind of nursing home your kids put you in some day.\n\nMy kids are now 27, 28 and 31 - they were all home for christmas and it was awesome, we spent so much time together, they had lists of the meals I needed to cook, invited kids I\'ve known for decades, I finally built a legit stone fire pit and we spent hours at night around the fire. You get that from really loving your kids and making them a priority; you really can\'t fake it or phone it in. But I still feel like the luckiest bastard on earth.'
###### b"Millennial dads wish their fathers spent more time with them.  That's why I spend time with my kids.  My dad just left for work every day and came  home tired every night to watch the weather channel.  He was a great dad, but not a very attentive one."

###### b"After moving and discussing with my wife how much I hated my new job.  We decided I could quit and watch the kids instead of them going to daycare. It has been some of the best time in my life getting to play with my kids every day instead of being burnt out from work when I get home.  It's an opportunity I thank my wife for as often as I can because my father was always on business trips and always tired."
###### b"My FIL is a great guy but would often call me 'mr mom' when he saw me giving our first kid (his first grand kid) a bottle. Despite having three kids he had never changed a diaper either. He would never admit it but I think he feels a little embarassed by his lack of baby knowledge to be honest, he just done what was the norm when he was younger but I think after seeing me with my kids he kinda thought 'oh I could have done that too'"
###### b'I recently thought about this from a bit of an "observer" perspective. I was raised by a single mother and other kids would often ask me if i\'m not "sad" about not having a dad. Which I wasn\'t since he was never in the picture. How would I even know what I\'m missing? The answer to which should be "because I saw other kids interact with their dads". But I didn\'t really. I would spend a fair amount of time hanging out at the places of my friends and I didn\'t even meet some of their fathers ever and when I did it was usually just a short greeting followed by them watching TV and us kids not being allowed to "disturb dad because he is tired from work".'
###### b'This backs up a lot of what I\'ve observed anectdotally. Ever since people my age (Gen X) and younger have started having kids, dads have noted that people from older generations want to give them some kind of medal just for spending time with their kids -- "Are you on babysitting duty?" (No, they\'re my own kids.) "Helping out mom today, are we?" (Why would I ever not be?)  TV and movies haven\'t caught up to the new reality, either -- see the still-common cliche of "oh no, Dad\'s been left alone with the kids!!" with ensuing wackiness/disaster.'
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a first generation Asian-American (Japanese) and never really interacted with my parents like how my friends interact with their parents. I think being a daughter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help since girls are lower on the totem pole in our culture.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never said or heard \xe2\x80\x9cI love you\xe2\x80\x9d to my parents. Even saying \xe2\x80\x9cThank You\xe2\x80\x9d to each other isn\xe2\x80\x99t something we ever say. I honestly think all I am is a baby maker in my parents eyes.\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time with my dad or mom growing up. I think I confided in my hobbies and online strangers than my parents.'
###### b'Are millennials killing the shitty dad industry?'
###### b'No amount of dollars can buy an hour of time with your father, and that is reflecting in the up and coming generation of dads.'
###### b'This could also be partly attributed to the number of people who feel empowered not to have kids. I feel a lot of people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want kids went ahead and had them because it\xe2\x80\x99s the societal norm. Therefore you had more parents who, well, not to sugar coat it, didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be parents.'
###### b'My dad never asked me "how\'s your day" or "how do you feel". Not once in my life. He doesn\'t know my ambitions or what my passions are apart from the obvious ones that everybody around me know. He is not a bad person but he is clueless about the emotional needs a father should provide.'
###### b'Goddamn millennials and their...attentive parenting.'
###### b'Can confirm. My husband did all of bathing, changing, nail trimming duties the first few months while I was being a delirious milk factory. Two years later he is the one who reads to our kid every night for 20-30 minutes, cooks her favorite meals, and takes her to playground on weekends. He can do everything if I were to leave house for any amount of time. \nThis is also cultural. \nI have a friend in her 40s, who is also a Russian immigrant in the US. \nThe other day she asked me to tell my husband to babysit our kid, so her and I can hang out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to explain it to her that dads don\xe2\x80\x99t babysit their kids.'
###### b"Being a millennial with kids, I can attest to this. I'm super involved with my kids and love spending time with them. My parents had very little to do with my upbringing. During my early years it was my grandpa, and once I was in school, my brother and I had to fend for ourselves. Both parents were there, but absent."

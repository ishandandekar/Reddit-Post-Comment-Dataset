## TIL the FBI has struggled to hire hackers because of the FBI hiring rule that the applicant must not have used marijuana during the last 3 years.
#### b''

###### b'"Marijuana? MARIJUANA!?" throws hat\n"I used to suck dick for coke"'
###### b"So, I don't have to worry about any of my stoner buds being undercover.  What a relief, was getting paranoid."
###### b'FBI: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke Marijuana?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHacker: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, just cocaine\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFBI: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s clean\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'They came to speak to the CS department at my college my freshman year. They begged everyone to stop smoking weed now so they could hire us when we graduated. And proceeded to say how many great CS people they had to let go for smoking.'
###### b'We have had a few unofficial conversations at my work among middle management. \n\nThey had talked about random testing and it was decided that was a really bad idea. We would lose 90% of the programmers and 75% of the field.'
###### b'I know I guy who is about as straight edge as anyone you could meet. He wanted to join the RCMP. He worked toward this goal for years, volunteering at the police department, getting in shape, never doing anything remotely illegal.\n\nWhen they did his security check they found out his sister had a record for dealing a little weed ( this was before legalization). They told him if he ever wanted to be a mountie he had to cut her out of his life. His sister.\n\nSo they lost an applicant who would have been one of the good ones.'
###### b'As a federal employee, I constantly hear how the FBI has the most archaic standards. A lot of federal law enforcement agencies have become too insular.'
###### b'Be a lot cooler if they did.'
###### b'Also they make them put their real names on their name badges instead of their awesome hacker names like Zero Cool, Crash Override, and Acid Burn.'
###### b'I was stationed at Fort Gordon for 3 years. I made friends with a lady that worked at "honey pot" down in the NSA dungeon. I had a TS clearance so she could at times give me some hints as to the problems they were encountering. Well, hiring was one of them. They wanted to conduct more "offensive" OPS and work on better tools to exploit zero-days they had discovered in popular apps being used overseas. I think their primary function was nation-state cyber shit. She told me that 70-90% of the people they wanted to hire could not qualify because they either smoked pot or had done it in the past few years. They also didn\'t like the antiquated and conservative dress codes, etc.\n\nI told her the story of the Russian dude that was able to garner NSA secrets a few years prior. I can\'t remember his name today, but the dude was a 400-pound pound pot-smoking, energy drinking gamer. Smart as hell though. He could breach systems like no other without being detected and was able to take advantage of 3-4 zero-days whole teams at the NSA could not figure out. So Russia hired him. He was actually Ukrainian if I remember. I think this same guy did some damage to Israeli and Saudi intelligence and had others inside of Russia helping him. I told her these are the guys/gals they want. If you tell them they have to work 9-5, dress up and go into work, not smoke pot--you\'re are 100% fucked.  This puts us at a huge disadvantage.\n\nI work in tech. And after I retired from the Army and started working for a large firm. My mind was blown how many smoked some pot on a Friday or over the weekend instead of drinking. It really changed my views on using it recreationally. Even the CEO smoked it and this motherfucker was worth almost a billion dollars at the time. And here my dad is telling me he\'s a "loser" for smoking pot. I\'m like, "that motherfucker is worth almost a billion dollars and has smoked pot his whole life. And he\'s a "loser"??? You kidding me dad?"  It\'s people like my dad and old conservative views on the workforce that are slowly widdling away at any advantage we ever have. I know for a fact we are way behind in the cyber realm.'
###### b'Free your mind and the hacks will follow'
###### b'I got interviewed by the FBI because a high school friend was getting a job with them.  He can\'t tell us exactly what he does but his education is unimpressive (decent college, no honors) and when we jokingly asked him to look into the JFK assasination for us he said he has "the lowest level of access to classified info of anyone in the place".\n\nWe\'re not particularly close, we didn\'t invite each other to our weddings.  The FBI must have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours looking into this very, very straight laced dude who, by the looks of things, earns like $80k.\n\nEdit: 80k is a very nice salary, but it means he\xe2\x80\x99s probably pretty low level as fbi employees go.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the clearance process for folks at the top of the bureau.'
###### b'TIL I cannot work at the FBI until May 14th 2023'

###### b'Most likely a security clearance issue. I\'ve heard stories about GS-15\'s (the high end of the civilian federal service pay scale) losing their clearance for a shitload of unpaid parking fines because it shows a "flagrant disregard for the law". Marijuana is still federally illegal, so there\'s no grey area officially. I think a lot of managers have a "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" policy about this in legal states. Don\'t ask questions you don\'t want answers to.'

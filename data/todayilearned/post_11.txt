## TIL a waitress was tipped a lottery ticket and won $10,000,000. She was then sued by her colleagues for their share. Then she was sued by the man who tipped her the ticket. Then she was kidnapped by her ex husband, and shot him in the chest. Then she went to court against the IRS.

###### b'What was that show "The Lottery Ruined My Life" or something like that?\n\nMan it was crazy - almost every story was about all the parasite pieces of shit that came out and claimed a portion of the winnings.  Even if they weren\'t even remotely associated with the person.\n\nI remember one of the winners saying something like "Winning the lottery is different than being really successful in business.  If you\'re really successful, not as many people feel entitled to your money.  But when you win the lottery, everyone feels like you just got lucky and therefore they\'re as entitled to your winnings as you are."'
###### b'>a simple Google of past lottery winners will present you with dozens of examples of how such a life changing win can quickly turn your life upside down.\n\n>The man from Georgia that invested his $3 million winnings in a meth ring. Urooj Khan was poisoned a day after winning in $1 million in July 2012. Michigan winner Amanda Clayton was found dead from a drug overdose less than a year after winning $735,000. In March 2012, a New Jersey jury unanimously decided that Americo Lopes had cheated his coworkers out of their share of a $38.5 Mega Millions jackpot lottery pool. Lopes claimed he had won the jackpot on a personal ticket but the panel rejected that theory. The jackpot was ultimately distributed among the five men who were in the lottery pool with Lopes.\n\n>And then of course there\xe2\x80\x99s the story of a Larry Payne, the East Alabama man who forgot about a lottery ticket in his truck. With just a few weeks before the ticket was due to expire, Payne lent the truck to his nephew. The nephew found the ticket and told his uncle. They thought it was only worth $600. Excited by the find, Payne\xe2\x80\x99s nephew told his boss. It later transpired the ticket was worth $1 million. The boss claimed that Payne\xe2\x80\x99s nephew had stolen the ticket off her desk. The case went to court and Payne was awarded the winnings.'
###### b'The golden rule - If you win the lottery... never tell a soul.'
###### b'I had to summarize what happened to her to fit in in the title, but so many amazing things happened to her. I thought it was amazing that she *lost* the lawsuit with her coworkers, but then won it on appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court.\n\nThe guy who tipped her sued because he said she should "buy him a new truck". That was dismissed.\n\nAnd other details are crazier, like she shot her husband in the chest, he took the gun, and then she successfully convinced him to let her drive him to the hospital.\n\nShe also won the case against the IRS. That was impressive.\n\nAnd she gave most of the money to her family, and works as a poker dealer.\n\nCrazy story.'
###### b'Ok let\xe2\x80\x99s kick this meeting off with some quick introductions. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go around the table, tell us your name and an interesting fact about yourself...'
###### b'The most unbelievable part of this whole story is that someone would name their kid Tonda Dickerson.'
###### b"This is why I'll never tell anyone when I win the lottery. Should be any day now..."
###### b'I feel kind of bad for laughing when I read the title, but it sounds like the plot of a comedy movie.'
###### b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s my thoughts. \nDude basically left a $1.00 tip, which he thought was worthless . He isn\xe2\x80\x99t owed anything. \nIf it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the standard for them to share all tips, then the colleagues aren\xe2\x80\x99t owed anything. \nEx-husband got what he was deserved. \nIRS will get their share.'
###### b'The first people you talk to when you win the lottery is an attorney and a financial planner with alphabet soup after their name.  CFA, CFP, CES, AAMS.'
###### b'This is why the biggest prize I want to win is Cash For life. People scoff at $1000/wk for "life" (25 years here) but that\'s 25 years making $52,000 a year (tax free in my neck of the woods). That\'s plenty to live comfortably, but not so much that everyone who\'s ever met you is going to come crawling out of the woodwork looking for a handout.'
###### b"This is the most unfortunate lottery story I've heard since the old man from the Alanis Morissette song."
###### b'Beating the IRS in court is way less likely than winning a lottery.'
###### b"Seriously people who win the lottery should just enter the Witness Protection Program or take their earnings and move somewhere else and start a new life. It's too dangerous to have all that money and still be in your everyday environment. People change when you have tons of money."
###### b"No-one's linked it yet, so here's a wonderful piece of reddit history: [what to do if you win the lottery](http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb51su?context=9).\n\nIt's very worth reading the whole thing."

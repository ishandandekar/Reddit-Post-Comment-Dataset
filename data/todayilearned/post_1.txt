## TIL Genghis Khan would marry off a daughter to the king of an allied nation. Then he would assign his new son in law to military duty in the Mongol wars, while his daughter took over the rule. Most sons in law died in combat, giving his daughters complete control of these nations

###### b'Definition of a win-fucking win scenario\n\nThe son in law is an able commander, you get multiple victories and a good heir to the throne\n\nSon in law is an idiot, you get his kingdom and the daughter can just be married off to the next target'
###### b"has there ever been a really good movie or series about Genghis? I feel like there's a lot of untapped potential, here"

###### b'Lol Kind of reminds me of that Roman lawyer, Varus, who married a powerful woman and thusly became a general, and led the 16, 17 and 18th Legions to their death East of the river Rhine in Germany around 6 A.D.\n\nHe had no business being in command of any army, let alone 3 legions. But they probably figured he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fuck it up. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t count on the cunning of Arminius, or Arminius\xe2\x80\x99s ability to succeed where all other had failed before him: in uniting the barbaric Germanic tribes together against a common enemy. \n\n[Awesome, awesome short dramatic documentary on the above happenings here.](https://youtu.be/93Wb9aa0-6Q)\n\nSeriously can not recommend that video or that Youtube channel enough. Have watched three of their videos so far, the one on Hannibal is freaking awesome too.'

###### b'Genghis Khan been playing CK2'
###### b'**Uriah has entered the chat*'
###### b'If he had the influence to just tell the allied king to join his army, it sounds like already had the power there.'

## TIL In 1959, police were called to a segregated library in S. Carolina when a 9yr-old Black boy refused to leave. He later got a PhD in Physics from MIT, and died in 1986, one of the astronauts aboard the space shuttle Challenger. The library that refused to lend him books is now named after him.

###### b'Hey, I heard about this on StoryCorps! https://youtu.be/okF5UGpivR8\n\nHis name was Ronald McNair.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for gold! My first :) \n\nI was also told to link this: https://youtu.be/ihF8PES8O20?t=112\n\nIt is his case in the Challenger exhibit'
###### b'If my library had turned me away as a 9 year old, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d be here today- it was always a safe place for me to go. As a sad kid, stressed teenager, unemployed adult. Libraries save lives!'

###### b"This guy is the reason I was able to finish college and go on to a PhD program.\n\nEdit: Wow! I hadn't realized that there were so many of us! Let alone so many that are also on reddit! If anyone feels obliged, I would like to hear what people are doing now with their degrees. Maybe ya'll can give me an idea about what I should do when I finally graduate?"
###### b' And his name was\n\n# Ronald McNair'
###### b"Similarly, university of maryland wouldn't accept a young black boy because they were segregated / racist fxcks. He later was valedictorian of his class at Howard, went on to desegregate the United States by successfully arguing Brown v Board. And was appointed as a Justice of The Supreme Court of The United States. After all his successes, the university of maryland had the gaul to name their library after that boy. I'm hopeful they have a plaque acknowledging their racist past so we never forget.  https://www.law.umaryland.edu/Thurgood-Marshall-Law-Library/"

###### b'I met Dr. McNair when I was ten years old in the fifth grade at a Magnet school in Houston, TX. He spoke at our school in December 1985 to encourage us to stick with STEM classes and never lose our fascination with the natural world. Such an inspiring man.\n\nI was crushed when he died in the accident not quite two months later. Our school specialized in a math and science curriculum. We had taken time away from regular classes to watch the Challenger shuttle launch in the morning. It was dead silence, except for a few muffled cries from some of my classmates.'
###### b'Just in case anyone forgets:\n\nMichael Smith\nJudith Resnick\nRonald McNair\nDick Scobee\nGreg Jarvis\nEllison Onozuka\nChrista McCauliffe\n\nI promised myself I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget their names. Unfortunately, I did\xe2\x80\xa6 But I periodically remind myself.'
###### b'This inspires the hell out of me. Proud black Carolinian with a doctorate. I know the struggle that he felt and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud and hope to be cut of the same cloth. \n\nRest In Peace.'
###### b'Imagine police officers entering a public library to throw a nine year old little boy out who just wanted to learn, simply because he had dark skin. It boggles my mind, my mum and dad were alive in 1959 fs.'

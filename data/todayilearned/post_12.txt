## TIL of Dr. Donald Hopkins. He helped eradicate Smallpox, and is on the verge of killing another disease. He's taken Guinea Worm Disease down from 3.5 million cases a year to just 28 cases last year.

###### b'Is he working with Jimmy Carter?'
###### b"Oh good grief... reading about the the Guinea Worm is a nightmare. Wouldn't shed a tear if they went extinct, even if that is highly unlikely to happen."
###### b">Chad, which reported 16 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 25 cases last year, has thrown a special challenge at public health experts: There, the worm has unexpectedly appeared in dogs, which must be tethered to keep them away from ponds but often aren\xe2\x80\x99t. To become extinct, Guinea worm needs to be eliminated from both human and canine hosts. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen that happens,\xe2\x80\x9d Hopkins says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be no place for this worm to come back from.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nInteresting, I thought humans were the only host for the worm. Hopefully their appearance in dogs won't be a huge setback because they're so freaking close to wiping these bastards out."
###### b'What a fucking boss!\n\nNurgle can go suck it!'
###### b'Pixar movie from the Guinea Worm Disease point of view... pretty intense.'
###### b">The seventh of 10 living children and the first born in a hospital, Hopkins attended segregated schools, carrying an \xe2\x80\x9calmost daily awareness\xe2\x80\x9d that the scribbles inside his textbooks belonged to the white kids who had used them first\n\n\nFrom the article. He's 76 years old. What an amazing man."
###### b'Anti-Vaccers: *cracks knuckles* "hold my kale smoothie"'
###### b'The worm can be pulled out a few centimeters each day. The process usually takes weeks. Permanent damage is uncommon.'
###### b"Hot damn! That's good, because Guinea Worms are fucking frightening. "
###### b'A true hero. '
###### b'Kudos to you doc!'
###### b"Wait wait wait wait wait.\n\nMILLIONS of people had Guinea worms every year? I can't think of many other things that would make me more convinced that a land needs to be evacuated and purged with fire than a few dozen of those cases. MILLIONS?!"
###### b'Man, when will these so called \xe2\x80\x9cdoctors\xe2\x80\x9d quit taking away our childhood diseases? They build character or something. And their vaccines are totally Big HARMa!\n\n/s\n\nIn all seriousness, that dude is great! Awesome legacy!'
###### b"Everytime I give up hope for humanity I see someone like this and it's restored"
###### b'Imagine being this guy. You have to feel like a total badass. \n\nWhat do you do for living?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kill disease\xe2\x80\x9d'

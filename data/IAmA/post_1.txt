## Protect Net Neutrality. Save the Internet.
#### b''

###### b"Here is a White House petition to [save Net Neutrality.](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality)\n\nEdit: Please share this link. We can achieve more than 100,000 signatures and show the White House how we care about Net Neutrality. \n\nEdit: We did it Reddit! Over 132,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. Don't get complacent, though. There is much we need to do to make sure Net Neutrality is saved. "
###### b'This is nuckingfuts... I entered in two different zips and both my representatives were NOT accepting calls or voice mails. \n\nI called the FCC directly from their website and they said they were "longer than average wait times". Then they gave an alternate route to make a complaint about the long wait. Then proceed to read long URL transcript... over the phone... not as a link. I tried to connect with a department NOT RELATED TO THE FCC CHANGES and a machine said they were not accepting calls and then hung up on me. \n\nI mean... why would they make it so hard for my voice to be heard.

###### b"Companies like Comcast and At&t are just wringing their hands in excitement thinking of all the possible charges they can hit us for. Call/email your reps today guys and gals! Don't let the piss in our faces and say it's a sense of pride and accomplishment. "
###### b"*** PLEASE CALL GUYS! ***\n\nEvery call helps, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let the FCC take away our protection to a fair and open internet.

And why would they want you using a competitors service when you can use their own service?\n\nComcast user?\nBoom!\n\n*Netflix is now a 5$ a month surcharge since Comcast doesn\xe2\x80\x99t own Netflix and would rather you use Hulu since they own a 30% share of through NBC-universal.\n\n*Buying any movie tickets not on fandango is blocked by Comcast since they own fandango.\n\n***HOW CAN I HELP?***\n\n***PETITION TO THE WHITE HOUSE***\n[The petition TO REMOVE MR.Pai](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/replace-ajit-pai-fcc-restore-net-neutrality-make-last-mile-networking-public-utility-and-stop-corporate-abuse-0) \n[Petition (thanks u/peacelovearizona)](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality) \nVisit these sites to help send calls and emails or to learn more about net neutrality \n\n* https://www.battleforthenet.com\n* https://www.eff.org/\n* https://www.aclu.org/\n* https://www.freepress.net/\n* https://www.fightforthefuture.org/\n* https://www.publicknowledge.org/\n* https://www.demandprogress.org/\n* http://www.gofccyourself.com\n\nWrite to  \n[House Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) \n[Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?OrderBy=state)\n[The FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact)\n[Add a comment to the repeal here](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=17-108&amp;sort=date_disseminated,DESC)\n\n[You can also use this to help you contact your house and congressional reps.](https://resistbot.io/) It's easy to use and cuts down on the transaction costs with writing a letter to your reps\n\n[Also check this out](https://democracy.io/#!/), which was made by the EFF and is a low transaction cost tool for writing all your reps in one fell swoop.\n\nMost importantly, ***VOTE***.

###### b'Copied from a previous thread\n\nAnd this is why we need to fight for an open, free internet.\n\nRules I like to follow :\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Always use a VPN (/r/Nologsvpn). This will encrypt your data so that no third parties are able to get it (ISPs etc) it also helps bypass Geo blocks, and protocol throttling.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Keep your social media usage as little as possible.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use throwaway accounts on Reddit. Especially if you give away identifying information or post in local subreddits.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Extra tip, use PGP on sensitive exchanges.\n\nIf anyone has any extras please share! :)'

###### b"What if you aren't in the US?\n\nEdit: What can I do if I live outside of the US?"
###### b"What is happening to the US? As a non-american, Everyday in the the news there is some issue that shows the US in bad light. The Hollywood sex scandals, Net neutrality, regarding elephant trophy hunting, the climate pact,etc. It's like the govt is taking a step backwards, not forward. So sad to see this. "
###### b"Just a reminder not to just upvote shit on Reddit and actually call these cantankerous slimey fucks. \n\nAjit Pai is *literally* a corporate crony that was Verizon's go-to lawyer when they wanted to fuck a bunch if customers over. He's a degenerate and now he runs the FCC. \n\n#DONT LET THESE GREEDY BAGS OF SHIT GET AWAY WITH THIS. IF ANY OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS VOTES IN FAVOR OF ABOLISHING NET NEUTRALITY, VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE#"
###### b"These are the emails of the 5 people on the FCC roster.\xc2\xa0 **These are the five people deciding the future of the internet.**\n\nThe two women have come out as *No* votes.\xc2\xa0 We need only to convince **ONE** of the other members to flip to a *No* vote to save Net Neutrality.\n\nBlow up their inboxes!\n\n* Ajit Pai - Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov\n* Mignon Clyburn - Mignon.Clyburn@fcc.gov\n* Michael O'Reilly - Mike.O'Reilly@fcc.gov\n* Brendan Carr - Brendan.Carr@fcc.gov\n* Jessica Rosenworcel - Jessica.Rosenworcel@fcc.gov\n\nSpread this comment around!\xc2\xa0 We need to go straight to the source.\xc2\xa0 Be **civil**, be **concise**, and make sure they understand that what they're about to do is UNAMERICAN.\n\nGodspeed!"

###### b'IAmA citizen of America who is always screwed over by my representatives because I don\'t have millions of dollars to bribe them into doing what I want them to do. AMA \n\nThis net neutrality "vote" is a just a huge middle finger to every American in this country. I hope it is shot down, but I will not hold my breath. I really feel like once again, money and corruption will win the day and the American people will have their faces spit in....again. \n\nIt really would be a nice change of pace if our elected representatives really represented us instead of just paying lip service. I don\'t care what anybody says about this being because Trump was elected, this is what they have collectively wanted for a long time now, and either way, they were going to wear us down until there was no fight left against it.\n\nMaybe when people have to start paying for Facebook, or they can\'t stream their Netflix or whatever else it will be worth their time and effort to do something. The apathy that lets these kinds of things happen is appalling.   '
###### b'well here in Arabic countries ! ALL calling application are blocked , many websites are blocked too . So I already know the feeling :)'
###### b"And they call the US government a democratic government, glad I'm from a country not controlled by jackasses and clowns, ffs, America doesn't have freedom, you have to pay for it..."

#### b'Hello Reddit! \n\nI\'m Alan Sealls, the longtime Chief Meteorologist at WKRG-TV in Mobile, Alabama who woke up one day and was being called the "Best Weatherman Ever" by so many of you on Reddit. \n\nHow bizarre this all has been, but also so rewarding!  I went from educating folks in our viewing area to now talking about weather with millions across the internet.  Did I mention this has been bizarre?\n\nA few links to share here:\n\nPlease help us help the victims of this year\'s hurricane season: https://www.redcross.org/donate/cm/nexstar-pub\n\nAnd you can find my forecasts and weather videos on my Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/WKRG.Alan.Sealls/\n\n[Here is my proof](https://twitter.com/WKRG/status/906301177154949120)\n\nAnd lastly, thanks to the /u/WashingtonPost for the help arranging this! \n \nAlright, quick before another hurricane pops up, ask me anything!\n\n[EDIT: We are talking about this Reddit AMA right now on WKRG Facebook Live too! https://www.facebook.com/WKRG.News.5/videos/10155738783297500/]\n\n[EDIT #2 (3:51 pm Central time): THANKS everyone for the great questions and discussion.

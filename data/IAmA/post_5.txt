## I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.
#### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to be back for my seventh AMA. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to answer your questions.\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.\n\nMelinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.\n\nOne of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.\n\n**Proof:** [https://](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)[reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant\\_wait\\_to\\_kick\\_off\\_my\\_seventh\\_ama/](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)\n\n**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I\xe2\x80\x99d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer as many as I can later on.\n\n**Edit:** Although I would love to stay forever, I have to get going. Thank you, Reddit, for another great AMA:  [https://imgur.com/a/kXmRubr](https://imgur.com/a/kXmRubr)'

## I’m American citizen, undecided voter, loving husband Ken Bone, Welcome to the Bone Zone! AMA
#### b"Hello Reddit,\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any of this coming, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a crazy week. I want to make something good come out of this moment, so I\xe2\x80\x99m donating a portion of the proceeds from my Represent T-Shirt campaign to the St. Patrick Center raising money to fight homelessness in St. Louis.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m an open book doing this AMA at my desk at work and excited to answer America\xe2\x80\x99s question.\n\nPlease support the campaign and the fight on homelessness! [Represent.com/bonezone](https://represent.com/bonezone/)\n\nProof: http://i.imgur.com/GdMsMZ9.jpg\n\nEdit: signing off now, just like my whole experience so far this has been overwhelmingly positive!  Special thanks to my Reddit brethren for sticking up for me when the few negative people attack.  Let's just show that we're better than that by not answering hate with hate.  Maybe do this again in a few weeks when the ride is over if you have questions about returning to normal.\n\nMy client will be answering no further questions.\n\nNEW EDIT:  This post is about to be locked, but questions are still coming in.  I made a new AMA to keep this going.  [You can find it here!](https://redd.it/63posi)\n\n"

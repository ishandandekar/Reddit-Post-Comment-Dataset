## FCC just voted to kill Net Neutrality. Now we will SUE THEM and FIGHT in Congress! We are Free Press & friends. AMA
#### b"The FCC just voted to throw out the Net Neutrality protections. Now cable and phone companies are free to block, slow down, or charge for fast lanes for content on the internet.

###### b'What specifically are you planning on suing them for? I completely agree with your motion by the way, I just want more information.'
###### b"What's the timeline for all of this going to look like? And what are the legal battles and congressional actions that we should be keeping an eye on in the coming months?"
###### b'As a run-of-the-mill American citizen, what can I do to help at this point?'
###### b"What exactly can you do that people haven't already tried? "
###### b'Fuck them up. \n\nPlease?'
###### b">Now cable and phone companies are free to block.\n\nThis is by far the biggest issue. Everyone is up in arms that their Netflix/FB/Instagram might get throttled. But I don't think any ISP in their right mind would do that because they would either be facing riots or hemorrhaging customers. (Edit: see edit below) \n\nBlocking information in the internet allows ISPs to manipulate and groom their customers for whatever agenda they want. This is beyond just a politics. This is a violation of 1st amendment rights. \n\nAre you guys thinking along these lines?\n\n**Edit**\n\nOkay to clarify - they may not be hemorrhaging customers, but if you do anything to take entertainment away from Americans you will not have a good time. Its like the kid that wants candy at the grocery store. They are gonna start yelling and screaming to make a scene. \n\nBut my main point here is people seem so fixated on the Netflix/Fb/etc. But the real problem is that ISPs can now control knowledge/information. Now apply Murhy's law. \n"
###### b'The FCC chairman has claimed there is no proof of bandwidth throttling, yet I do recall that Netflix and Comcast had many issues in the past.\n\nWhat proof will you bring to your case? Or do you have any tech experts on your side? Can you get Bill Gates?'
###### b'Has anything like this (from the FCC or other regulatory organization) been overturned in court? If so, how long could it take? The courts are very slow of course, but could public interest increase the speed? Are you thinking within 2 years? 4 years / in the next administration? \n\n*edit: fixed some spelliing'
###### b'To what extent does the FCC\'s decision to disregard (1) the quantity of pro net neutrality comments, and (2) the "cyberwar" campaign to flood the site with fake comments affect whether a court will conclude today\'s vote was arbitrary and capricious? \n\nThe "arbitrary and capricious" doctrine sets a high standard of proof necessary to prevail in a civil action. '
###### b'Just me being curious here. Is there any way that I as an European would be able to show my support for American net neutrality? '
###### b'Do you think there is a chance of success of repealing the repeal?'
###### b'Serious question.  Did you sue them before 2015? If so what was the outcome? Is that how we got NN originally?'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"I'm a lawyer and would love to join your cause. Do you need more litigators?\n"
###### b"What's to stop every state from just making their own ISPs that don't charge for fast lanes? How is Comcast stopping them? "

## I am Senator Bernie Sanders. Ask Me Anything!
#### b"Hi Reddit. I'm Senator Bernie Sanders. I'll start answering questions at 2 p.m. ET. The most important election of our lives is coming up on Tuesday. I've been campaigning around the country for great progressive candidates. Now more than ever, we all have to get involved in the political process and vote. I look forward to answering your questions about the midterm election and what we can do to transform America.\n\nBe sure to make a plan to vote here: [https://iwillvote.com/](https://iwillvote.com/)\n\nVerification: [https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1058419639192051717](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1058419639192051717)\n\nUpdate: Let me thank all of you for joining us today and asking great questions. My plea is please get out and vote and bring your friends your family members and co-workers to the polls. We are now living under the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. We have got to end one-party rule in Washington and elect progressive governors and state officials. Let\xe2\x80\x99s revitalize democracy. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a very large voter turnout on Tuesday. Let\xe2\x80\x99s stand up and fight back."

###### b'In your opinion, what is the most pressing issue facing our generation today?'
###### b"Bernie\n\nHow can we stop the war in Yemen? Why do we continue to operate on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia? Why don't we try to actually engage in a healthy relationship with Iran? \n\n\n\n"
###### b"If you could replicate the USA's economics on another country's economics, which country would it be?"
###### b'you smoke weed?'
###### b'Do you believe there should be more citizen involvement in government or just the opposite? Also what do you think of the current education system in the U. S'
###### b'Hi Bernie!\n\nHow will a single-payer healthcare system actually save Americans money? How is it that America is paying more per capita for healthcare relative to other developed nations that have implemented single-payer?'
###### b'Thanks for this AMA.\n\nHow can we do better to combat disinformation? It\'s such a difficult thing, and the goalposts are ever-moving when it comes to "free-speech." How can we identify and combat blatant lies without violating constitutional rights? This is on my mind constantly, and I have no idea.'
###### b'Thanks for this AMA senator\n\nIf Democrats take control of the senate or the house after the midterms, what is the the first piece of legislation or issue you\xe2\x80\x99d like to work on?'

###### b'Hi Senator. What, if anything, can we expect the Democratic Party to do about student loan debt? \n\nAlso, under Obama there were too many unemployment extensions given out. However, under Trump there are zero extensions being given. I am unemployed and am putting an overwhelming amount of effort into getting a new job. However, my unemployment is now up and I have yet to land a new position. Now I have barely any income on my part (I am married) and a 3 year old son to take care of. The nanny position I took while I am job searching in my field barely pays anything. Do you think it is possible that something could/will be done about the extensions? '
###### b"Hi Bernie,\n\nI gleefully voted for you and strongly believe in your platform. However here in the Bay Area you have, a few times now, endorsed candidates for state office who strongly oppose policies to bring in new high density housing construction. (Specifically Jane Kim and Jovanka Beckles). Job growth has occurred rapidly here but construction of new housing has failed to meet that burden, and the result has been rapidly increasing rents and housing costs, with disastrous results for the working class.\n\nWith your endorsements, you've aligned yourself with candidates who support policies that will exacerbate this scarcity.\n\nWhat is your position on urban housing development, and its role in housing affordability in areas with rapid job growth? Do you support higher residential density in urban areas with low carbon emissions and good public transit? Or should America continue its pattern of suburban sprawl and accompanying auto emissions and habitat loss? If you do support higher density, how do you reconcile that with your endorsements?"
###### b'Hello Senator Sanders,\n\nI was a huge supporter of yours in 2016 in my home state of Washington. I caucused for you, donated, and spread your message to all willing to listen. I was fortunate enough to attend your rally at the UW campus that year. It was magnificent!\n\nOne of the major reasons I supported you, apart from the obvious stuff (Medicare For All, Decriminalizing Cannabis, reigning in Corporate powers), was the fact that you largely have avoided pushing excessive gun control in your home state of Vermont.\n\nAs a racial minority who genuinely isn\'t sure whether or not I can trust Law Enforcement to protect me, I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, as well as the ownership of commonly owned rifles. I know "assault weapons" are a highly contentious point of political conflict, but I would hope that, as a nation, we could discuss the ramifications of reactionary gun laws and the unintended consequences they may have on the American people.\n\nAs you yourself witnessed during the Civil Rights Era, our laws tend to disproportionately impact specific groups, namely racial minorities and the poor. While I do greatly wish to see action taken to reduce gun violence, I have a hard time imagining how criminalizing the ownership of 50+ year old rifles will improve the already divisive nature of our country. Just like our drug laws, new gun laws will impact racial minorities and the poor before it affects those who *truly are* a threat to community safety.\n\nMy question is this: **What can I do, as a left-leaning liberal gun owner, to better highlight my concerns to a Politician willing to listen?** I\'ve sent countless emails and letters to my local representatives, only to be brushed off as an "NRA Supporter" or something similar. I despise the NRA for a variety of reasons, and I\'m not here to represent their misguided attempts at being true representatives of the American Rifleman. I want a serious dialogue with serious people who are willing to treat this issue with the respect it deserves.\n\nGun ownership is a right that belongs to ALL American people, and I fear that the polarity on this issue will result in further division when we *should* be coming together.\n\nThanks for the AMA!'
###### b'What can we do to prevent climate change from killing humanity?'
###### b"Senator,\n\nActive duty military members can usually only vote via absentee ballots. In that case, most feel that their voting rights are infringed. What can we do to counter this, and how would the candidates you're endorsing ensure that our military isn't forgotten?"

## I am a 100 year old human and a World War 2 veteran. I want to share my life and experiences with people who might be helped by them. Ask me anything!
#### b'Greetings!\n\nAs you may have imagined, the person typing and facilitating this AMA is not the 100 year old human, but his granddaughter, me!\n\nA little bit about my grandpa: he grew up in Washington State, and has traveled quite a bit. He worked for the FDA for many years, some as an investigator, some as a pharmacist. He served in the air force during World War 2 as a photographer.\n\nClearly there\'s more to him than this, so ask him some questions!\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/pFBHcWZ](https://imgur.com/pFBHcWZ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nY\'all he is enjoying this so much! He\'s flabbergasted at how many people are asking questions and upvoting him, at first he thought it was all people I knew haha. He\'s so happy! We\'re gonna take a little break, some of my family just arrived for a visit.\n\n4:14 PM ET: we\'re back! gonna knock out some more questions until I have to dip. Appreciate all the interest! Sorry he sometimes misunderstands some questions aha.\n\nWith a lot of these I\'ll ask him and he says \'let me think about that a bit\' and I\'ll circle back and I guess he hasn\'t finished thinking about them - so sorry for those still waiting! lol\n\n5:05 PM ET: So he\'s starting to fall asleep as I ask him questions, so I think we\'re gonna call it a day aha. He\'s in rehab for a broken hip right now, and a bit forgetful and confused at times, so hopefully that will give some explanation to some of the stranger answers he\'s said. Thank you so much for everyone who asked things and commented and told stories and thanked him, he is just so pleased!!! I\'ll go through this as I\'m able and answer what I can from my perspective. Next time I visit him, I\'ll try to get a few more answered. He\'ll remember this for a long time. Thank you all, SO MUCH!!!\n\n11/6/19 5:39 PM ET: Hi all! I stopped by my grandpa\'s current place today and asked and answered a few more questions! He gets tired pretty quickly, and tends to say "I need to think about that" for things that aren\'t direct (broad questions like "meaning of life" and such), so for further questions I would encourage more specific questions. I\'ll continue asking him things as we\'re able - there are a lot to go through, but I and we appreciate the interest so much - every time I update him about the number of upvotes, his face lights up :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people have been requesting pictures, so here they are:  [https://imgur.com/a/0yz41Nq](https://imgur.com/a/0yz41Nq) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we\'re here and this has so much visibility (wow), I\'ve gotta put this out there, cause I\'d really love to have the opportunity to live as long as my grandpa has: WE NEED CLIMATE ACTION!!! We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don\'t have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn\'t just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it\'s been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that. Links below for some organizations I like (but there are definitely others, so please, look them up and find one right for you!) (note: while my grandpa is not super hip about all the aspects of climate change, I have shared my life with him and he has been super supportive of me in my journey of action, and for that I am so grateful) JOIN, TAKE ACTION, SUPPORT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, AND/OR DONATE PLEASE, I WANT US ALL TO LIVE AS LONG AS MY GRANDPA <3\n\n[https://www.sunrisemovement.org/](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/)\n\n[https://rebellion.earth/](https://rebellion.earth/)\n\nthicc list:  [https://www.usclimatenetwork.org/member-organizations](https://www.usclimatenetwork.org/member-organizations)'

###### b'I\'ll put his more rambling answers to questions that haven\'t been asked yet haha.\n\n"During the war with Japan, there was periods of time that the Navy would set forth on the map a 30 mile stay-out area, and it was such we had to go back in and photograph it but in the meantime we photographed outside of the 30 mile radius. When I say we, I mean the photo-planes. Flight \\_\\_ was in the area to fill in the 30 mile circle that hadn\'t been photographed when the president announced the bombing of Hiroshima." Right after the president announced, everyone was scrambling to see what flight foreign air would bring back, because our cameras were used to make pictures 18 inches wide 9 inches deep, in europe they used the same camera with a lens arrangement taking 5 inches square fo wherever they were flying. And so the word came down to my repaitrmen and me that our cameras better not fail this time because they had longer service periods than those in europe. In the theater, we thought those photographs were very restricted. Within less than several weeks, our pictures were in some of the public photo magaiznes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe japanese had invaded some western part of the phillipinnnes. the photo planes photographed where they were. prints were made, all large size, at least 8 by 10 or larger, and they were asked to deliver by air to the ground troops near the japanese. The first attempt at that, they dropped a package of them, but it got torn up, so they asked for further prints, and they said this time...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"The p-30 photos took pictures. the first picture stopped, did ht ephoto work, took the pi. They put a red flag on a pole, please see if you can come close to it. The pilot who came knocked the red flag down. he radioed back, is that close enough?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"During college, I was in pharmacy and the baptist church rented a room where once a week people could gather there and have a fish and chip lunch for 35 cents..."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n"I graduated in highschool in 1937, was one of the few boys in a school of 300 that had his own car, that\'s because I went out and got a job delivering papers that I enjoyed doing. Several things I learned from the gas station, there was a fella that had a Cadillac Oldsmobile and every time he went somewhere it would squeak, the dealers tried to fix it but I figured out what to do due to my dads suggestion to me to figure out how something works then do it. That way I can give help to my dad, my father in law, and other people I knew"\n\nHis dad was very mechanically oriented'

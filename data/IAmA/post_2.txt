## [AMA Request] Victoria, ex-AMA mod
#### b"**My 6 Questions:**\n\n1. How did you enjoy your time working at Reddit?\n2. Were you expecting to be let go?\n3. What are you planning to do now?\n4. What was your favorite AMA?\n5. Would you come back, if possible?\n6. Are you planning to take [Campus Society's](http://blog.campussociety.com/an-open-letter-to-victoria-previously-of-reddit-become-victoria-of-campus-society/) Job offer?\n\n**Public Contact Information:** @happysquid is her twitter (Thanks /u/crabjuice23 And /u/edjamakated!) & /u/chooter (Thanks /u/alsadius)\n\n\nEdit: The votes dropped from 17K+ to 10K+ in a matter of seconds...what?\n\nEdit again: I've lost a total of about 14K votes...Vote fuzzing seems a bit way too much\n"

###### b'Do you remember the last time a fired Reddit employee did an AMA? I highly suggest she take all this online goodwill and get a high paying, lucrative PR job. '
###### b'"Victoria will be helping me out today!"'
###### b'Her doing an ama would unleash more popcorn than when the last employee got fired '
###### b'Holy shit that was fast. I totally support this request. Maybe she can get help from Victoria :)'
###### b"I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing. "
###### b'Did this just drop 6000 upvotes? '
###### b"Let's hope OP doesn't get shadowed and this whole thread removed "
###### b'Surely the first question has to be "why were you fired?"'
###### b'IM trying to find her contact info since her email wont work most likely. anyone got a lead?'
###### b'She almost certainly has a confidentiality agreement'
###### b"What the fuck?! I leave for 3 hours and this has dropped from 10k votes to 5k?\n\nUhm... something's fishy, here."
###### b"Holy shit...14532 and 97% upvoted\n\nNever thought I'd see that unless Snowden and Assange announced they were getting married. "
###### b'Did this post just go from 17k to 10k upvotes?'
###### b"/u/chooter, you're our only hope."
###### b"Dude, you're about to overtake Obama's AMA in terms of upvotes after only one hour. This is a little bit mad."

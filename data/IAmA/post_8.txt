## I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.
#### b"I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to be back for my fifth AMA. \n\n\nMelinda and I recently published our latest Annual Letter: http://www.gatesletter.com.\n\n\nThis year it\xe2\x80\x99s addressed to our dear friend Warren Buffett, who donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation in 2006. In the letter we tell Warren about the impact his amazing gift has had on the world.\n\n\nMy idea for a David Pumpkins sequel at Saturday Night Live didn't make the cut last Christmas, but I thought it deserved a second chance: https://youtu.be/56dRczBgMiA.\n\n\n**Proof:** https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/836260338366459904\n\n\n**Edit:** Great questions so far. Keep them coming: http://imgur.com/ECr4qNv\n\n\n**Edit:** I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to sign off. Thank you Reddit for another great AMA. And thanks especially to: https://youtu.be/3ogdsXEuATs\n\n\n"

I have a question pertaining to an issue in the U.S. and it's one that we're all get sick of hearing.\n\nDo you think social media - [and perhaps the internet in general](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/may/13/internet-confirmation-bias) - has played a role in helping divide this country? \n\nInstead of expanding knowledge and obtaining greater understandings of the world, [many people seem to use it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/)\n\n1) seek and spread information - including false information - confirming their existing biases and beliefs, and\n\n2) converse and interact only with others who share their worldview\n\n(these are things I'm guilty of doing myself)\n\nFollow up q: What steps should we take to help bridge this social, cultural, economic, educational and regional divide?"

## I'm the Monopoly Man that trolled Equifax -- AMA!
#### b'I am a lawyer, activist, and professional troublemaker that photobombed former Equifax CEO Richard Smith in his Senate Banking hearing (https://twitter.com/wamandajd). I "cause-played" as the Monopoly Man to call attention to S.J. Res. 47, Senate Republicans\' get-out-of-jail-free card for companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo - and to brighten your day by trolling millionaire CEOs on live TV. Ask me anything!\n\nProof:\n\n - https://i.redd.it/6cmuac6dv1qz.jpg\n - https://i.redd.it/kji1krugv1qz.jpg\n\nTo help defeat S.J. Res. 47, sign our petition at www.noripoffclause.com and call your Senators (tool & script here: http://p2a.co/m2ePGlS)!\n\nETA: Thank you for the great questions, everyone! After a full four hours, I have to tap out. But feel free to follow me on Twitter at @wamandajd if you\'d like to remain involved and join a growing movement of creative activism.'

###### b'Will you be using the Monopoly Man getup for future public appearances (including as a subversive protest, but also, say, in court)? Relatedly, how do you recommend others to become as badass as you? \n\n:) <3'
###### b"Public Citizen called arbitration clauses a \xe2\x80\x9cget out of jail free\xe2\x80\x9d card for companies. What advice do you have for people who don't want to fall victim to these hidden clauses?"

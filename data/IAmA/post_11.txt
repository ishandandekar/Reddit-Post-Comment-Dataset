## I’m a lobster diver who recently survived being inside of a whale. AMA!
#### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m Jacob, his son, and ill be relaying the questions to him since he isn\xe2\x80\x99t the most internet-savvy person. Feel free to ask anything about his experience(s)!\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/RaRTRY3\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for all your questions! My dad and I really enjoyed this! :)'

###### b'Hey Jacob, how are you?'
###### b'What is your second craziest diving story?  \n\nI read in the article that you see a lot of white sharks, have you ever had a close encounter with them or do they generally steer clear?'
###### b'How do you feel about all the attention and news stories?'
###### b'[removed]'
###### b'The article talks about you maybe being the last lobster diver in your area. Is that true? Why is that? And my biggest curiosity about the job, does it pay well?'
###### b'Did you find any lobsters in there?'
###### b"What's the most interesting thing you've seen while under the surface diving for lobsters?"
###### b'Jacob - what was your reaction when you were told what happened to your dad? Did you believe them?'
###### b'Has it deterred you at all from your job, or is it business as usual for yourself?'
###### b'Was its tongue smooth like a dogs or scratchy like a cats?'
###### b'How long were you trapped?  Were you concerned at any point that you might die?'
###### b'What was your \xe2\x80\x98last thought\xe2\x80\x99 when you realised you\xe2\x80\x99d been eaten by a whale?'
###### b'I live near you and do lobster diving in the area. Do you think this whale learned it\xe2\x80\x99s lesson or should I also be worried I might be swallowed alive?'
###### b"1. How did you get out?\n2. Were you able to see anything?\n3. What bad things could have happened inside which didn't happen fortunately?"
###### b'Do you commonly see whales while diving? Is it unusual that they get close to divers?'

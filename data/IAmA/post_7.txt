###### b"I'm a former Scientologist and Sea Org member. I was raised in Scn and joined the SO as a 15-year-old girl and was in for six years. I'm still dealing with the effects of the abuse I endured in the SO. I just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken. I feel like even when people are rightly negative about Scn, they still don't really get it, and it's difficult to talk about. So, thank you for doing what you're doing, and for being an example for someone that gets it.  What has helped you get through the leaving process and the intimidation from the church?\n\n"

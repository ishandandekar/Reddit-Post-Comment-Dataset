## ULPT If you ever get caught sleeping at your desk at work then say "They told me at the Blood Bank that this would happen" when asked for a reason
#### b''

###### b'Works better with a bandage '
###### b'My boss would just say "Omar commutes 2 hours a day back and forth by train and has a kid and a pregnant wife at home. You\'re 24 and you\'re bitching about a little blood being drawn???" \n\nEdit: For the record, Omar is happy with his job. He\'s project manager, makes 6 figures and has accumulated a lot of time off. It\'s an honor working with him. Don\'t want to make it seem like he\'s struggling, even though the job does get stressful really fast. '
###### b"I learned in school to sleep with with my head up. I'd prop my arms on the desktop to hold me up. I'd hold a pen in one hand pretending to be taking notes, and have an open book in the other pretending to be reading it with my head lowered. \n\nThe trick is not to jump or act surprised if the teacher walks by and shakes you to see if you are sleeping. You just slowly turn your head and respond. Do it slowly though to give your brain time to catch up."
###### b'You can also claim you are allergic to polen and you took antihistamines which induce drowsiness'
###### b"Capitalizing on the ULPT to say the holidays are a time when blood donation is at its lowest. Please consider going in if you're able.\n\nEdit: [US site](https://www.redcrossblood.org), you can check for a nearby drive. Whole blood can be as quick as 20 minutes. Platelets can take 2 hours (or longer), but you can chill and watch TV or a movie. Platelets only last 5 days without freezing, so they're always in demand."
###### b'Someone clearly forgot that November through late March can be written off as "cold & flu season," and blaming your sleepiness on taking over the counter medicines is the REAL LPT.'
###### b'"Amen"'
###### b'If I tried this at work my colleagues would say "fuck off Jali-Dan don\'t be a twat"'
###### b'Yea but what about if you work at the blood bank?'
###### b'The best one I\'ve heard is "If you have your own office that gives you privacy, close the door and lay down with your feet right at the door, scatter office supplies around your head(like paper clips) so when someone opens the door they wake you up and you can just play like you were picking up dropped supplies."'
###### b"I doubt that after waking up from a  long nap you'd remember this random unethical life tip"
###### b'And if they ask you your blood type, and you are not sure, just say O negative (universal donor).'
###### b'Just say, \xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d before opening your eyes. Boom.'
###### b'*"Yeah, sorry Boss. They had me up all night at the Sperm Bank."*'
###### b'LPT if you ever catch your employee sleeping at work, ask them if they are all right before you yell at them. '

# r/UnethicalLifeProTips
## ULPT: If the person sitting in front of you on a flight reclines their seat all the way back and leaves you with no room, turn on the air con above you to full blast and point it at the top of their head.
#### b'If their sensitive to it (especially if they\xe2\x80\x99re bald), they\xe2\x80\x99ll straighten up their seat. If not, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll both be uncomfortable for the entire flight.'

###### b'As a tall person I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if someone puts their seat back - but it gets annoying as hell when they keep rocking and banging the seat back and forth all the time. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s payback time.'
###### b'This would actually feel good!'
###### b"So now I get two AC's!?!?!?"
###### b'I miss the days when the person in front of you reclining their seat was the worst part about flying. Something about traveling these days really turns people into rude and inconsiderate beasts. Manners seem to be very lacking, and I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about many ages/colors/creeds.'
###### b"This isn't unethical, it's passive aggressive. Unethical would be putting eye drops in his drink while he wasn't looking so he spends the entire flight in the bathroom or dead."
###### b'Pay it forward and recline your seat all the way back...... *everyone reclines their seat back*\n\nSource: been on a plane.'
###### b'Im not sure what planes most people fly on, but the ones I have been in only recline like 2-3 inches. Negligible.'
###### b'I firmly believe that airplane seats should not be able to recline'
###### b"I usually look behind me before I recline my seat back at all to ensure I'm not going to interrupt the person behind me or knock over a drink...but several times I've had full force full reclines from the person in front of me during meal time or when I have a laptop out. Drives me bonkers."
###### b'I had a lady once put her seat back all the way from a flight from Hong Kong to LA. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind so much bc I was dozing and listening to music. I DID mind however when she had the audacity to tell me to stop touching her chair every time I shifted. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be jostled then move the FUCK back up Karen.'
###### b'Just for the love of god recline slowly.  People think they are in a fucking springloaded lazyboy.'
###### b'6\'7", took a flight last weekend with my SO. We were just about to get the exit seats when this 5\' girl and 5\'6 guy right in front of us takes them. In a classic, valley girl tone the girl literally said "Let\'s get these ones because they\'re the \'good\' seatssss." My SO and I decide to sit behind them. Me behind the girl and my SO behind the guy.\n\nSince I\'m tall, my legs are immediately pressed against the back of the seat. Seriously, I can\'t take my knees off the back of the seat even if I wanted to and I couldn\'t change seats because it was a full flight. I really wanted to too because damn, it gets really uncomfortable after awhile. \n\nSo we go up in the air and this girl tries to recline her seat. I can\'t move my legs so she goes nowhere. She continues trying to recline it for 10-15 minutes, expecting me to back down or something. One time she actually reeled back and slammed her back into the seat, causing the guy to tell her to calm down because the flight attendants took notice. For the rest of the flight she would turn around and glare at me whenever I shifted to relieve the pressure off my legs.\n\nI understand that everyone likes some leg room, but seriously, these planes just weren\'t built for tall people.'
###### b"I remember trying to convey to the senior in front of me on a chinese bus that she cannot recline as I just do not have the room. I'm 6'2, which is kinda tall in Canada but gigantic in China. I was using broken chinese, but she did not seem to get it. Finally her (early 20s?) granddaughter said something and she brought it back up.\n\nI ended up chatting with her granddaughter, who spoke english, over the course of the trip, turns out the grandma knew perfectly well what she was doing and what I was saying, but required shaming by someone Chinese in order to change.\n\nI've always been appreciative of the granddaughter for taking my side there, and the conversation we had. It made a much more comfortable 14 hour trip."
###### b'Recline if you want to \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s your right. But know that the person behind you is going to resent you for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s just how it works, like a lot of other choices you can make in our society.'
###### b'The seats were made to recline.  Once the person in front reclines, I do the same.  \n\nBTW, aircon on my bald head feels good and I\xe2\x80\x99d actually like it'

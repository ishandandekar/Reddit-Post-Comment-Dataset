###### b'Try putting the business card with \xe2\x80\x9csorry\xe2\x80\x9d on the windshield even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the parked car. They\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a good amount of time looking for what is wrong with their car.'
###### b'Hit car of person you don\xe2\x80\x99t like; leave business card behind of another person you don\xe2\x80\x99t like.'

###### b"Yo wtf ... this actually happened to me\n\nSome dude called me up heated ... whoever hit him left a fake number (or that's what I assumed). \n\nTold him sorry, but you got the wrong guy, homey wasn't believing me. Good thing I was 3000 miles away. Hung up eventually after lots of name calling. "
###### b'Even better: Use your own business card and then be very apologetic and claim someone must have used your card without permission.'
###### b'Ulpt: do this but don\xe2\x80\x99t actually hit their car so they spend an eternity looking for damage '

###### b"Real talk,  I've done this before. \n\nI kept getting business cards in the mail, and then one night I dinged some person's car in a Kmart parking lot one night. I wrote on the back then left it under the wiper blade. \n\nThis was almost 2 years ago, and no repercussions yet. I also don't go to that Kmart anymore, so that might help. "

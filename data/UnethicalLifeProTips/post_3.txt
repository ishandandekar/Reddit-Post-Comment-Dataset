## ULPT: If a relative keeps asking you about having kids, lie that the wife is pregnant. A few months later, tell them there was a miscarriage so they'll feel uncomfortable bringing up the subject again.
#### b"This is a repost from last year but the holidays are coming up again so thought I'd bring it back."

###### b'You underestimate my family\xe2\x80\x99s lack of empathy...'
###### b"Alternate route: Say that you're trying, but not having any luck.  Then engage them in a long and extensive conversation about positions, ovulation timing and cervical mucus."
###### b'When people ask me about having kids i put on a bit of a serious/sad tone and say:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cwell... my wife and i, we really tried but we cant have kids\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nThen i wait for the \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry to...\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nand I continue my sentence\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah its just that we fucking hate kids\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'Prefer the "we\'re practicing all the time,  we practiced in the bed, on the couch, in the kitchen" usually works to stop the barrage'
###### b'This is good stuff that I expect from this sub. Up you go.'
###### b"This could backfire big time though if you aren't careful."
###### b'LPT: inform your wife prior.'
###### b"This has a chance to backfire and have your family asking when you're going to try again more frequently and try to convince you that you shouldn't give up, miscarriages happen to lots of women, blah, blah, blah."
###### b'My brother would text his FIL \xe2\x80\x9cjust tried for a grandkid again.\xe2\x80\x9d The questions stopped pretty quick.'
###### b"Ask them why they're so interested in when you're going to bareback your wife again."
###### b'The alternative answer, of you want to go less long term, is reply "We plan on having them but every time someone asks us when, we move the date back 6 months."'
###### b'I just say \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been ejaculating inside my wife *constantly* over the last couple of months. I\xe2\x80\x99m just pumping load after load after load into her. I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand where it all goes. That girl has had *gallons* dumped into her and she\xe2\x80\x99s still not pregnant. It\xe2\x80\x99s bananas.\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'My dad told people he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to have kids\n\nAnd thats what I tell people. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wish we could but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'Yeah. Until your *other* family member asks the same question and the one you\'re talking about now says "Oh they had a miscarriage."\n\nAnd you forgot to tell your S/O and she\'s like "Yo. The fuck you talking about?" and it just went from unethical to suuuuuuper fuckin awkward. Well more than "I\'m gonna have a baby!" then three months later "Miscarriage. Now stop asking."'

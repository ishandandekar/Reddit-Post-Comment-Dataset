## ULPT: if you accidentally scratch someone’s car, write a note in shaky handwriting saying you are 5 years old and fell off your bike. Then leave $5 saying it’s all you had
#### b''

###### b'"Sorry my bike left a 30 inch scratch on your car.  Here\'s $5"'
###### b'Or just leave thats more unethical'
###### b'*Sees the note.*\n\n*Sees a large gash from back to front of the car.*\n\n-Did he fall at terminal velocity from his tricycle?'

###### b'This is from that r/wholesomememes post?'
###### b'5 seems like too young of an age to be believable.  I\xe2\x80\x99d go with 8-12. But maybe I was just a dumbass 5 year old'
###### b'5 year old would absolutely not care they dented a car or realize that it even matters.\n\nSource: Was clumsy 5-year old'
###### b'Better tip:\n\n\nIf you scratch or hit a parked car, leave a note saying you observed someone hitting their car and leaving. Pick a random car and use that vehicles make, model, and license plate. Done and done.'
###### b'Do you ever actually get tits in your inbox?'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"I've got to stop reading these; I actually think that this might work"
###### b'Remember to use your non-dominant hand to write the note.'
###### b'M E T A \nE \nT\nA'
###### b"Doesn't fly when u hit a Tesla"
###### b'This makes no sense. What 5 year old would leave a note? And why would they have pen and paper on them on their bike?\n\nSo dumb'

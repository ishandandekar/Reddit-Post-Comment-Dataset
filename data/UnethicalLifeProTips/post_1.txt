## ULPT: Look up your buildings washer/dryer model on eBay and order a key for it. I haven’t paid for laundry in years and it cost me $8.00! Sleep like a baby knowing you’re not paying for on-site laundry.
#### b'EDIT: There seems to be some confusion about this. I\xe2\x80\x99m not referring to opening up the coin deposit box of the laundry machines, rather just the control panel that allows you to start the cycle. Do not touch the coins! Thx for the gold/silver.'

###### b'A ULPT that is useful. Laundry pirate ahoy.'
###### b"I tried to do this once and couldn't find it after searching for 5 minutes and gave up"
###### b'Jokes on you my mom still does laundry for me.'
###### b'Is it really for the model of the washer/dryer or for the model of the lockbox? Or are they one in the same?'
###### b'Most commercial dryers and washers and other vending machines have tubular locks which can be easily picked with these tools [these tools](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RXJGSVH/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_kRWpDbS8PPZTX) with no skill required and the best part is that once you pick the lock you can now have a key because the tool is the key.'
###### b'Some washers have a "maintenance mode" which is basically a menu that lets you change prices. For example with certain Speed Queen models you have to press the 2 top left buttons at once to open the maintenance menu.\n\nMaintenance menu also lets you start the machine without putting money in. \n\nYou can usually get a manual for free online to figure out how to access your machine\'s maintenance mode. Or just send an e-mail to the manufacturer saying that you\'d like a copy of the manual for your business or whatever. \n\nThere is however a switch inside a panel on the machine that you need to flip before you can even access the maintenance mode, usually only accessible with a screwdriver. I assume this is so that people can\'t just change prices whenever they want. If your laundry room doesn\'t have a camera it should be just a 5-minute job to open the panel and flip the switch.\n\nThe office manager at my current apartment lives in the same complex with his family and I\'m pretty sure he rigged like 3 washers/dryers to be able to access maintenance mode, so he wouldn\'t have to pay for laundry. Saw his kid in the laundry room once pressing a bunch of buttons and the machine just starting by itself, which prompted me to do more research on laundry machines. Been saving like $30/month for the past 2 years.'
###### b'My apartment complex just switched out the washers and dryers recently, I was super excited about it. That is until I went to use them and found they double the price per load. I was thinking about doing this and this post has absolutely pushed me to do it now.'
###### b'I found out that by shutting off the breaker for the coin dryer before the timer runs out, it resets the timer to 45 minutes.'
###### b'This is a true ULPT.'
###### b'This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be unethical for me. The washers in my unit have errored out multiple times, robbing me of money. I\xe2\x80\x99d feel okay about this.'
###### b'Another ULPT: use expired, pre-paid Visa cards in these machines for free laundry. Most machines store credit card numbers and only connect to a server once or twice a day and will accept any "valid" credit card number and then bill it later. I stole a full year of free laundry from my old apartment complex this way'
###### b'My laundry rooms on each floor have security cameras in the room so this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work for me sadly lol but all the power to the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have cameras on them!'
###### b'Most police issue crown vics (and other ford fleet vehicles not made within the last few years) are all keyed alike to the 128X key'
###### b"Wow! didn't expect this to get such a response. Thanks to everyone who upvoted and thanks to whoever gave me my first Gold! Shucks!"
###### b"FYI GUYS: Make sure your complex doesn't have cameras in their laundry rooms before doing this."

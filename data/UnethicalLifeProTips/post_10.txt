## ULPT: When you give someone a gift card as a gift, write down the card number and code. Then after a year or two, check the balance and if they hadn't used it yet, just use it yourself. They obviously won't know or care.

###### b'So somebody did this to me and my wife with their wedding gift to us.  Took about a year for us to get around to using the gift card, and when we finally tried to use it, there weren\'t enough funds on it.  We called the gift card hotline and they confirmed it had been spent in the store already at a location near where the gifter lived (another state).  Wife decided to call this woman out on it.  Definitely awkward, and I don\'t think they speak anymore.\n\n**Edit**: For everyone asking what the woman said, she said she "mixed up her cards".  Like people just have a bunch of Bloomingdales gift card numbers that they\'re juggling'
###### b'"Why does Jake always give me gift cards to Outback Steakhouse? He *knows* I\'m a vegetarian..."'
###### b'Playing a real long game for 20 bucks or so.'
###### b"THIS - gifted a \xc2\xa3100 gift card to a cousin who is really interested in things for a month or so then completly forgets about it / gets bored of it so I wrote it down and behold, a really good time after I checked the same code with different others and it...went through. Great, 100 in my pocket but I don't gift expensive shit to her after that..."
###### b"This will be buried but my mom did this to me many years ago. I received a $50 or $100 Walmart gift card for Christmas and didn't have a need for it at the moment so I set it aside. Months later when my daughter (who didn't live with me) needed school supplies I remembered I had it and sent it to her mom.\n\nYou can imagine the tirade that ensued and how I was reamed mercilessly for allowing them to make it all the way to the checkout and have the card be useless.\n\nTurns out mom had taken the money back about 6 weeks after sending it.\n\nThanks a lot mom, you really helped me help your granddaughter."
###### b"I just give people straight up cash. I find gift card is a scam that everyone buys into so they don't look cheap if given too little. At the end of the day, people don't really care much about you as they got stuff going on themselves."
###### b'This has hilarious back fire potential'
###### b'A new gift card has a cover over the code, do you plan to remove the cover before you give that card to someone?'
###### b'Alternative: Give them an empty Amazon card. If they ask about it, say oops and send it to them digitally.'
###### b'LOL, I\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely used gift cards several years after using them just because I was excited to save it. That would suckkkkkkkkk if The balance was gone lol.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t do this shit'
###### b'"must have been hacked"'
###### b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have to scratch the thingy?'
###### b"Most gift cards have a pin you would have to scratch off to actually use. I don't see this as a great ULPT in 2020"
###### b'LIFEPROTIP TIP: Give people birthday cards and then have a smaller envelope inside with another birthday card in it. Inside that second birthday card, put another sealed birthday card. Do this about 10 times and, in the final card, don\'t have a gift card or anything. Just put like a few stickers or something with a note that says, "Sorry, I spent on of your bithday money on birthday cards." It\'s important that you include that misspelling. Also, just make all the birthday cards yourself because it\'s cheaper. Make sure they\'re comically shitty.'
###### b"I was gifted an iTunes card back in 2013 & vowed to use it on Tool's next album which ended up being released in 2019. Took me until this year to locate said card & follow thru with the purchase. Then sent a message to the person thanking them for my birthday present on a random Tuesday. They were like W.T.F? I then explained what I did.\n\nHence I would have been pissed if that card was empty after saving it for something special."

## ULPT: If you’re initiating a divorce, secretly arrange consultations with ALL the best divorce attorneys in your area before choosing one and filing. Once they have met with you, even briefly, they are considered biased and will have to recuse themselves from representing your spouse.

###### b'https://uproxx.com/viral/dumb-guy-asks-for-legal-advice-on-reddit-then-asks-for-more-once-it-backfires/\n\n> Apparently they found out what I did, probably because it was so hard for her to get an attorney, and today I just got hit with a motion for attorneys fees saying that what I did was abuse of process, an attempt to deprive and interfere with justice, bad faith, and a bunch of other stuff. And that I have to pay part of her attorney fees because I made it more expensive for her.\n\nEnjoy paying your spouses lawyers! Also paying to fuck yourself in the divorce.'
###### b'Most consultations are about $300 per hour, depending on your region. Must really want to ruin the other party....'
###### b"Seems like if you're in a small enough area, opposing counsel might bring that up to the judge as an example of how petty the parties can be."

###### b"If you're in the military make sure you hit up your post lawyer before your spouse does. This way you get a free lawyer, they have to pay for theirs, or they have to drive far to the next military base for a free one."
###### b"Someone on /r/exmormon did this at some point and the judge made him pay extra for his wife's legal fees.  This sort of thing only works in fiction, because divorce law allows judges quite a bit of leeway, and when they see you pulling this sort of bad faith shit they will stomp you down.  Divorce isn't win or lose like criminal law, and it's not a jury trial, so having the better lawyer is an asset, but isn't everything, so doing this would just serve to start you off on a bad foot with the one dude who holds your life in his hands."
###### b'If a court finds out you did this then you\xe2\x80\x99re smoked. Larger firms allow firewalls (formerly \xe2\x80\x9cChinese walls\xe2\x80\x9d) to protect from conflicts within the firm. Plus the number of people to meet with is tremendous. \n\nThis does happen occasionally with expert witnesses in oddly specific area. Imagine how few train track and wheel braking experts there are in a geography? If you retain them all, opposing council will need to get an \xe2\x80\x9cout of state guy\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to live and work here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEdited: I removed some comments about how this is a myth. I understood \xe2\x80\x9cbrief consultation\xe2\x80\x9d to mean a phone call saying, \xe2\x80\x9cdissolution of marriage is my issue, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to retain you. What are the next steps.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nReddit\xe2\x80\x99s understands \xe2\x80\x9cbrief consultation\xe2\x80\x9d to mean 1) setting up an appointment. 2) pass the firm\xe2\x80\x99s conflict check\xe2\x80\x94in case your spouse outwitted you. 3) provided material information to your case. With those clearer definitions, sure\xe2\x80\x94an attorney client relationship is formed regardless of pay and conflicts rules (namely ABA model rules of professional conduct 1.7 and 1.9 come into play. \n\nWhat remains is that this is highly impractical, potentially costly, and if your spouse goes to four firms and is conflicted out of all of them, two things will happen. \n\n1) your spouse will know you\xe2\x80\x99ve shopped your case around to dozens of firms \n\n2) the judge is going to be displeased that there are shenanigans. \n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t do this. It\xe2\x80\x99s dumb. The whole ULPT is dumb.'

###### b'This is a very time consuming way to find yourself in hot water with the judge before any proceedings even begin.  Courts are not stupid and do not take kindly to childish tricks to try and prevent someone else from obtaining a lawyer.'
###### b'Really ? Is this true or make any sense ?\n\nHaving an initial meeting with an attorney to discuss whether you would hire them as your lawyer should not automatically make them ethically compromised. Unless I am missing something ?'
###### b'Learned this from watching The Sopranos.'

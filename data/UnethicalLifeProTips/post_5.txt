## ULPT: Give your kids a bag of coal each for Christmas this year. When they cry just tell them Santa is wrong and you'll get it sorted. Once the shops open buy what they asked for. They will think you are a legend and Santa is a dick. You will also get the presents for half price.

###### b'Not to mention the coal will only increase in value each year! Dont let this information leak to the mainstream fat cats!! '
###### b'You had a rough childhood man '
###### b'I asked for coal one year in addition to the presents I actually wanted. I thought Santa would appreciate my honest evaluation of myself. It worked pretty well. Had a great Christmas. Still have the coal too.'
###### b'Half price? Since when do electronics go on sale at half off the day after Christmas?'
###### b"Are the presents half price because you don't have to worry about the Santa tax this way?"
###### b'What gifts that kids actually want go half price after christmas? I dont think anything I have every wanted in my entire life went half price after christmas. You guys only buying your kids christmas themed candy or something?'
###### b'I just realized I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to buy coal.  Except for charcoal.  I guess that would work, kids are pretty dumb. Weird, though, that something so ubiquitous is, at the same time, hard to find.'
###### b"Does no on else go to their neighbors house to unwrap presents and then you have to leave before the next family gets there or they chase you out of the house? That's why there were no presents under the tree when we got back to our house duh."
###### b"We would never get presents. We would go to the store and look at all the empty shelves. We're Jewish. "
###### b'My kid asked for coal last year because it\xe2\x80\x99s useful in Minecraft...'
###### b'What happens when years later they find out Santa is actually Satan? \xe2\x80\x94 I mean a scam to stimulate the market by taking people\xe2\x80\x99s hard earned money at the end of the year. '
###### b'One time i asked for coal.'
###### b'No, you\'re doing it all wrong.  First you go to the butcher and get cheap cuts of meat like liver and heart, intestines etc. $5 total.  Then you go to a thrift shop and get the cheapest Santa suit you can find. $2.  Then you go the dollar store and get a Santa beard and $20 worth of toys etc. then you find a red sack.   \n\nThen, when your kids are all asleep dreaming of elves and reindeer and there\'s a gentle snow fall glistening with an orange hue of the high pressure sodium street lamps and you see a bunny jumping in the snow and it\'s a peaceful beautiful night,  you get the Santa suit and lay it by the chimney, then you get the organs and blood, chop it up and smother it all over the Santa suit and on the floor, once the scene is set, you get your pistol and fire a few blanks, when your entire family freaks out and comes running down the stairs, you say "I got the fat bastard!" And when your family says you killed Santa, you say " listen here kids, it\'s time you know the truth, I capped Santas ass.  It was a mistake, you don\'t want daddy to go to jail do you? So this is what we\'re going to do, if you don\'t say anything, you can have all of santas loot, and you take out the giant red sack full of dollar store junk, and say "do you want it". \n\nWhen the kids see that giant sack full of toys, they\'ll forget all about you murdering santa, and you avoid the first time a kid learns he can\'t trust his parents and they\'re all a bunch of freakin liars who had them all excited and happy before they destroyed and ripped their innocence and trust from their loving hearts.  Because that\'s what counts, brutal life lessons about betraying kids trusts for the first time.'

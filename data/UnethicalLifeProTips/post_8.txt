## ULPT: If you live near a US military base, it's a really good time to install Tinder.
#### b'Military girlfriends/wives are FREEEEAKKKKS. And their spouses are about to be deployed for at least a year. Start making those inroads now.\n\n**Edit**: my name is Bill, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind the wives of the butthurt to call me Jody.'

###### b'My buddy left on deployment and his wife fucked two guys left behind from his own unit. She tried for 3.'
###### b'I was getting out of the Army in 93 and I was undeployable.   My unit was sent for training for 3 weeks, Kosovo (edit: Bosnia not Kosovo) was happening and it was looking like my unit was going to go.  All the married guys asked me to go to the club and look out for their wives.  I had like 8 guys asking me if I saw their wife out.  I had to tell 3 of them that I saw their wives making out with other dudes the night after they left.  It was not a great scene for those guys.\n\nas far as this post, this is a great tip with a good percentage of working.'
###### b"Do I have to listen to their MLM pitch? That's a deal breaker for me."
###### b'Any time is a good time near military bases. I\'m on the East Coast with Army, Navy, Air Force and Naval Air Bases in the same area. When a carrier is deployed the boat is still at port and the wives are in the bars. "I needed someone to hold me because I never knew if my husband would make it home alive", bitch, your husband scoops food onto a tray below the hanger bay of an Aircraft Carrier and he\'s currently 6 miles away.'
###### b'My cousin met a guy in the Army while living in VA. He was from KY. She banged a couple of dudes while he was deployed and got pregnant. She told him what was up, they worked it out and reconciled. He was sent someplace over seas for a few weeks for some training and when he got back guess who was pregnant again! He moved back to KY.'
###### b'* Lives near area 51, matches with actual freaks *'
###### b'Go door to door on base and sell those sex toy parties.'

###### b'This is absolutely true. I grew up in a military family and fortunately in Guam where I got too see how crazy some military parents (mostly wives) were. I lived there at age 9 for 3 years. I guess putting some of these people on an island really brought out the crazy too. A lot of my friends parents there were alcoholics and addicted to pain killers. The parenting didnt transfer very well to some of my friends at the time. Years after moving back to the states, I had learned 3 of my friends from Guam had gone to jail and were absolute druggies now...\n\nIf you are, or are going into, the military, please be very careful who you date and/or decide to marry. They might be absolutely nuts and mooch off of your military benefits and travels.'
###### b"I used to move furniture and handled many military moves. The local guys I hired as labor told me they were knee deep in military wives who's husbands were overseas or deployed. \n\nThat's some cold shit. Dirty."
###### b'When I was fresh out of high school, a buddy of mine went to the Marines and was deployed to Japan. While in Japan, his best friend started banging his gf. It was the worst. He would call her sometimes and they\'d both be hanging out with us, and he would get on the phone like, "Tony (not his real name)!!! Buddy what\'s up man! We miss you!" Yeah, clearly not that much since he was banging the dude\'s gf. \n\nAnyway, it was one of those moments when you\'re like, "hmmmm, maybe I shouldn\'t hang out with these people." Remember kids, you are only as good as the people you hang out with, so stop hanging out with slime!'
###### b"I have the utmost respect for our troops. My girlfriend's husband fights for our freedom every day."
###### b'Thanks for the tip, Jody.'
###### b'Plot twist. He dies in battle and you knock her up. Enjoy child support.'
###### b"Just what I need in a year: A marine upset I've been banging his lady."

## ULPT As a parent of a baby, smell their diaper. If you DON’T smell poop, say, “Woah, somebody has a poopy diaper. “ Then take them to the other room and pretend to change them. Then the next time they poop tell your spouse, “It’s your turn. I changed them last time.”

###### b'This only works if you have a partner that gives a fuck about taking turns '
###### b"I tried this but it doesn't work when you dont have a wife, or kids.\n\n I can't believe she took the fucking kids\n\n\n Edit: its a meme guys"
###### b"Not worth it. The number of shit diapers my wife changes has an inverse relationship with her level of chill and therefore my will to live. Dealing with feces is no big deal to me because I'm Winston Wolf and I solve problems. I'll change the baby every time if I've got time."
###### b'This is one of those posts I\xe2\x80\x99m glad my boyfriend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have Reddit. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking this one lmao '
###### b"Wouldn't they find out if there's not a diaper with poop in the trash?"
###### b"Never thought there would be a tip that requires you to sniff shit. Won't see me doing that anytime soon."
###### b'"Honey I\'m worried. Penelope has filled her diaper twice in the last 20 minutes."'
###### b'You can peek in their diaper by pulling from the back and seeing if they pooped because chances are they will actually have pooped sometimes and you may not want to shove your face in a poopy diaper. You can feign the same reaction while visually inspecting. '
###### b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a bitch ass move. '
###### b"LPT: don't have kids"
###### b'Am I the only man in the world that assumes full responsibility for my child? Like what are all the other guys gonna do if their SO dies in a fire or something? Put the baby up for adoption?'
###### b"It works better if you don't have children in the first place. No need to worry about these kind of things. A friend was telling me how babies' noses get blocked and you have to unblock them by sucking the snot out (with some baby snot tube - in the past they used to suck it out directly from the nose - I'm sure some people still do).

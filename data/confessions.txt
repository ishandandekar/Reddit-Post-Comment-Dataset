##### b'To anyone in a similar situation, before you move visit a lawyer and create a trust. If your last name is Smith, do not call it the "Smith Family Trust"  Put your new house, cars, etc. in the name of the trust. Because online property searches are a thing.'

##### b'In another life I was a cop. I was sent to a situation very similar to this. The kid was 15, we\'d been dealing with him for nearly 10 years. He was a Mike Meyers style, Chucky incarnate, bloodthirsty, remoresless, psychopath. The parents did everything they could to help him, but he was broken and nothing worked. The kid ended up hurting a younger sibling, or nephew, or something (2-3 yo girl) pretty bad. He wasn\'t even supposed to be there, but he snuck in to attack a baby. The dad beat him unconscious. Then kept beating him. Then kicked his ass out the front door and called us. \nThis was in TX. "Reasonable discipline" is allowed, and required by state law. After talking to the CID Captain and an assistant DA, we all decided the dad was being reasonable. He was fully prepared to go to jail, but under the circumstances, the desire to protect the baby, and convince his psycho kid that such behavior would never be tolerated.... was reasonable. They sent the psycho away somewhere after that, and we never heard from that family again. The whole situation was sad and it sucked. I rarely believe these confessions, but this one is 100% possible.'

##### b"*I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.*"

##### b'He would have definitely murdered many people if it weren\'t for that "intervention". He is definitely either in jail or dead, maybe living on the streets. Hopefully isn\'t hurting anyone. Still, reading about how he got beaten up and left to die made me cry. It\'s fucked up, everything about this. I don\'t blame you or your wife. The fact that he continued to trash the place makes me think he was clinically insane. This is all terrifying to think about, especially him shuffling around barely alive upstairs. I\'m glad you kept your sanity'

##### b"Why didn't you commit him to a mental institution? This kid was a classic psychopath,  \n& irredeemable. The doctors would have backed you up.\nSeriously, it was where he belonged."

##### b'He is probably either dead or in jail. From your description there really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything else you could do. It sounds like he had some major mental imbalances and you tried everything. I am surprised you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have him locked up in a psych ward.  I am sorry you had to live through hell and still are living it to some extent.'

##### b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t usually read super long posts but this one was way worth it . Your wife was amazing ! Soon as he hurt that little girl of yours she just snapped . And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be ! You guys tried so hard to get him to be a normal kid . He was just born evil and conflicted . Don\xe2\x80\x99t beat yourself up about it . I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you guys put ip with it as long as you did but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you no longer have to suffer from him . Hopefully he did get help and was able to become normal .'

##### b'If your son was white, about 5\'6" tall thin, and had green/blue eyes, dark brown hair, and a scar on his left hand from where his teeth sliced into his skin while being "Jumped" then I might be your grandson.\n\nMy father was born in the spring months of 1971, he claimed he had no relatives, and was a cruel horrible person until the second he died.\nI\'ll probably post that story on this subreddit after I get off work. \nBut suffice to say that I endured everything he dished out in the 8 years I was forced to live with him.\nI\'ve witnessed him killing cats, and dogs, he lit my hair on fire a couple of times because he liked the smell, and I have several scars from his use of knives as a correctional tool. I\'d appreciate it if you could send me a pm and we can see if you\'re really my grandfather or if two horrible people matching the same description and characteristics were born in the same season of the same year in the same country.'

##### b"This is legit the most troubling thing I've ever read. And to be fair? I understand your wife in that situation. She wasn't beating up her son, she was defending her daughter from a demonic murderer. \n \nThat of course doesn't mean I support violence, but in that situation I would have done a similar thing."

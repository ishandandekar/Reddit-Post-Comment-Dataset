## Willy Wonka (1971) Theory: New and Not Dark!!
#### b'With the golden ticket scheme, Wonka was trying to expand his company\'s empire. All five of the children were specifically chosen because of their preexisting relationship to food. Take a look at Veruca Salt. Her family owns a nut factory, a logical business pairing with a chocolate manufacturer. Mike Teavee is an unwitting expert on media, advertising, and technology because of his addiction to television. On the tour, Wonka specifically shows Mike the prototype for Wonka Vision. Although Mike fails the test, I believe Wonka\'s original goal was to put Mike in charge of this innovative technology. Violet Beauregarde holds the world record for gum-chewing, so who better to help with the development and advertisement of his new Three Course Dinner Chewing Gum? Violet could give some valuable input on the creative process, and she could use her gum-chewing fame to promote the product. On top of being known for his appetite, Augustus Gloop\'s father is the most prominent butcher in Drusselheim. Perhaps Wonka was looking to expand to a more international market, or invest in foods unrelated to chocolate. Lastly, I think Wonka chose Charlie Buckets to be the heart of the company. His rags to riches story would inspire and give the big business some emotional capital. He also comes from a frugal family, so he knows how to be efficient with finances. It is important to note that Charlie is the only one who "wins" in the end, so although Wonka\'s original intent was to branch out to four new markets, Charlie\'s good heart was the end goal for Wonka\'s company vision.'

###### b'I like it. Explains why he was so peeved at the end, because his business plans for the next decade or so fell apart because these kids fucked everything up. When he yells at Charlie "you get nothing!", it\'s because Wonka is projecting since he subsconsciously feels that he himself got nothing out of this whole scheme. Then when Charlie gives the gobstopper back, he sees at least there\'s potential here for a new CEO down the line and it wasn\'t a total loss.  \n\n\nI\'ll see your theory and raise you another. Everything we saw of the factory in Willy Wonka wasn\'t the "real" factory. Why would there need to be a chocolate river and a boat and things like that if nobody ever goes there? I believe the factory is just like a regular factory but Wonka is very secretive about his product and not wanting competitors to obtain his recipes, so that naturally creates a lot of mystique into what\'s happening behind closed doors. With floundering sales, Wonka decides to capitalize upon this mystique and essentially build an entire chocolate amusement park to pander to these kids fantasies, all the while increasing purchases of Wonka bars. Sure, he makes them sign a ridiculous waiver at the start but that\'s more for the grownups, he knows that kids will be kids and Veruca and Tommy TV and the gang will tell all their friends about the ridiculousness they saw at the Wonka factory, creating even more folklore about Wonka and keeping his business afloat, but when they leave, it will go back to being just a boring old, but now immensely profitable factory.  \n\n\n&#x200B;'
###### b'Your theory is a description of the mindset of the people that made the movie. It\'s made by a candy company. From [Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory on Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory): \n\nThe idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart\'s ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with "Uncle Dave" (producer David L. Wolper) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl\xc3\xa9). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar.'
###### b'Jesus Grandpa Joe is such a piece of shit'
###### b'I think this a great theory. I think there are some flaws. Wasnt the apparent intention of Wonka for there to be only one "winner" of the "lifetime supply of chocolate" which was actually taking over the whole company, right? Doesnt he explain to Charlie that he was looking for a child to pass everything on to? \n\nSo, if Wonka wanted to pass the company on to a child for a specific attribute such as the fathers nut company or the child\'s TV marketing acumen, then why not just pick that child? Why have this elaborate elimination process that leaves everything to chance... now that I think of it, the whole plot of the movie doesnt really make sense if Wonka was setting out to find an heir, he went about it in the most bizarre and ineffective way...\n\nAnother issue is that, weren\'t the tickets purchased and discovered at random? I mean, it is by sheer chance that Charlie found a coin in the gutter that allowed him to even afford a chocolate bar, and Veronica\'s father was sifting through thousands of boxes to be able to randomly find one. So, Wonka couldn\'t have specifically chosen those kids, right? Unless there was a deeper conspiracy to plant the tickets In the bars they purchased, but then that\'s really far out there.\n\nSorry I dont mean to crap on your theory, I like it, but I think the attributes of the characters you point out may have thematic significance, but not necessarily representing a hidden intention of Wonka'
###### b"I like this.  All the kids could have won if their vices hadn't stood in the way, but they didn't so Charlie  gets everything.\n\nAlso Wonka probably also considered that Charlie was a local and that would be useful as well."
###### b'The Allegory of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a biblical allegory about the seven deadly sins and the three primary virtues from Corinthians 13:13\n\nThe bad children and their parents represented the seven deadly sins, of course:\n\nGloop/Gluttony\n\nTeeVee/Wrath and Sloth\n\nSalt/Greed\n\nBeauregarde/Pride and Envy\n\nThe parents/Lust (for Wonka\'s empire).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWonka, Uncle Joe, and Charlie represented the virtues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWonka/Hope - He knew bad and evil people would get tickets, but he held out hope that one would be worthy.\n\nUncle Joe/Faith - Joe never doubted, and always believed that Charlie would be the one to win the prize. He states that repeatedly.\n\nCharlie/Love - Charlie was the embodiment of innocence and purity throughout the book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor, at the end of the tour, this was the theme - Cor 13:13 "*And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."*'
###### b'I love how this is the only post on this sub that has the spoiler tag, and its for Willy Wonka'
###### b'As another poster has mentioned, this kind of falls apart when considering the random nature of the ticket distribution, unless you want to invoke some supernatural manipulation.\n\nBut that aside, I\'d like to offer a modification to the theory.  What if Wonka planned on Charlie all along, but wanted to give him a helping hand at the start.  Instead of using the other kids for expanding his own business, which wouldn\'t make sense in light of how he tormented them, what if he wanted them to help contribute to *Charlie\'s* success?  Charlie could call them all up and unite them by using Wonka as the enemy - "Hey remember how Wonka tormented you?  I was sorry to see you go through that, and wanted to help make it better by involving you in the new way I\'m running the factory."'
###### b'It actually makes sense for a candy manufacturer to pair with a butcher, that way you got a nice, fresh source of bones and skin for harvesting gelatin for candy.'
###### b"I like this one. It makes sense, and it doesn't involve the extinction of humanity or a train in the snow."
###### b'I love this theory, except it would be really hard to get those tickets to the right people. Especially Veruca. '
###### b'>On top of being known for his appetite, Augustus Gloop\'s father is the most prominent butcher in Drusselheim. Perhaps Wonka was looking to expand to a more international market, or invest in foods unrelated to chocolate.\n\nThe theory kinda falls to pieces when you can\'t come up with any reasonable excuse for one of the kids at all\n\n"A more international market"? Did you forget that these kids are international? Or how about the whole "people around literally the entire world searching for a golden ticket" thing? That was kind of a big plot point'
###### b'I had to read "Charley and the chocolate factory" in economics class. It was written about the economy at the time. We had to find five economic principles on the book. '
###### b'I currently work in a building that is themed all around this movie (the building is literally named chocolate factory and has Wonka written everywhere). Thinking about printing this out and putting it up above a few urinals. '
###### b'*clap clap clap* so you finally uncovered my plan...'

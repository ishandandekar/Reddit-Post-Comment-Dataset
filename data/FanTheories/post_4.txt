## Predator (1987): The alien tries each man's masculinity. Each man who dies does so in a manner befitting his swagger.
#### b'It\'s a well-worn idea that _Predator_ is a film about masculinity. You have seven men each competing for alpha status, showboating their strength, stoicism, roughness and physical power. I\'d like to go a step further. I\'d like to suggest that the trials of the film are a test of masculinity, and that each man who dies does so in a way that mocks his masculine performance.\n\nLet\'s go through the kills in order.\n\n**Hawkins**\n\nScrawny, glasses-wearing radioman Hawkins is the first to die. Appropriately enough, he is the least successful in projecting his masculinity. He fails to crack bawdy jokes about his girlfriend\'s vagina, finds little useful intel for the team, and kills no-one during the guerrilla camp raid.\n\nHe dies when he runs after Anna and catches the attention of the predator. Out of context, the scene almost resembles a rape - Hawkins chases Anna and wrestles her to the ground. But this dynamic is reversed when the predator runs him through, drags him on his back, strips him naked and disembowels him.\n\nDo you remember the joke he keeps telling? It\'s about how big his girlfriend\'s "pussy" is. The predator essentially carves him a fairly large one of his own. We see him moments later, dangling upside a tree, a gaping hole in his belly.\n\n(A ghoulish detail: Judging by the naked marines Billy discovers at the start of the film, similarly skinned and upside down, the predator doesn\'t just disembowel men - it castrates them.)\n\n**Blain**\n\nBlain\'s not the weakest of the remaining crew, but he is certainly the showiest, with his enormous minigun. Blain has the most famous line outside of Arnie\'s: when he\'s shot in the arm, Ramirez rushes to his aid - "You\'re bleeding, man!". Blain\'s having none of it: "I ain\'t got time to bleed".\n\nIndeed he doesn\'t. When the predator fires a plasma bolt through Blain\'s torso, the resulting wound is bloodless:\n\n    DUTCH\n    ...Just like the others...no\n    powder burns, no shrapnel.\n    \n    DILLON\n    The wound all fused,\n    cauterized...what the hell\n    did this?\n\n**Mac**\n\nYou remember Mac. He\'s the one who snatches Dillon from behind, threatening that if he blows the team\'s cover, Mac will "bleed him slow and quiet". He\'s probably the least mentally stable of the gang: by far the most menacingly violent, and with a propensity to talk to himself. When the Predator escapes the team\'s trap, Mac takes chase, babbling to himself, mentally decomposing into a violent trance.\n\nYou\'d think that if anyone can out-sneak the predator, it\'s Mac, but the predator has him sussed fairly quickly. Sliding on his back, Mac suddenly sees a target on his wrist. It runs over his arm and head and - blam!\n\nAt first, it wasn\'t obvious to me how Mac might have prompted this death in particular. But I recalled two things: firstly, that Mac constantly, ritualistically shaves his head. He\'s doing it right from the first time we see him on the helicopter. So a headshot seems appropriate, though I\'ll admit the tie is a little weak. \n\n(It may be the only one in the film, though, if you interpret Ramirez\'s death as neckshot.)\n\nWhat\'s more, Mac\'s apparent madness makes his head his \'weapon\'. He\'s just a little crazy, and that\'s supposed to make him scary, but there\'s no brain chemistry so unstable it can\'t be met with a well-placed microwave pulse. So mocks the predator.\n\nAnother matter I remembered is his threat to the predator the night before: "I\'ll carve my name into your skin". It\'s actually the predator that marks Mac, with his laser sight. The triangular target is the nearest thing we ever get to the alien\'s calling card, and it\'s traced over Mac\'s flesh slowly and carefully. Eventually it is visually \'imprinted\' on his head by force.\n\nA final, tenuous link: Mac promises to \'bleed\' Dillon \'slowly\'. Mac\'s own death seems to be the slowest: even when his forebrain is blasted apart, we see his body continue gasping and twitching until at least scene cut (and therefore implicitly longer). Everyone else dies fast.\n\n**Dillon**\n\nDutch\'s old friend from some unnamed army unit, Dillon is keen to show he hasn\'t softened with promotion into the higher ranks of military brass. He greets Dutch with an arm wrestle, and he loses. This turns out to matter.\n\nDillon has his arm lasered off and is shortly run through by the predator\'s claws.\n\nThis death is the most obviously telegraphed: it\'s the same arm. In the former scene, the arm is brought to the ground as it desperately pushes back; in the latter, the arm falls to the ground firing its weapon impotently.\n\n**Ramirez**\n\nSlim and wiry, Ramirez isn\'t a major presence in the movie, so this one\'s a little tougher to read. If you can\'t remember, he\'s the green beret who gets hit by the log trap, sent flying and landing in a crippled heap. He limps along for a little while before being unceremoniously shot in the neck.\n\nRamirez\'s greatest swaggers happen in the guerrilla camp raid. Carrying a six-shooter grenade-launcher, his well-placed blasts fling enemies through the air over and over. I counted four shots of men being thrown towards the camera by explosions in that scene, and three of them belong to Ramirez. (The other is a grenade from Billy). The film fixates on these shots enough to conclude they\'re supposed to be impressive, so it\'s a pointed irony that Ramirez is thrown through the air in a similar manner.\n\nNot convinced? There\'s a little ad-hoc addition to the original screenplay. When Blain boldly asserts he "ain\'t got time to bleed", Ramirez quips back: "Oh yeah? Have you got time to duck?". Ramirez is later crippled by a fast-moving log to the chest that everyone else jumps under.\n\n**Billy**\n\nBilly doesn\'t swagger. He acknowledges his fear, listens to his superstitious instincts and generally prefers to act rather than talk. He is granted the most noble death of all the soldiers: an off-screen fate that preserves his mystery and lets us imagine - or rather hope - he died bravely.\n\nBut he dies all the same, because he chooses not to run. And that is the difference between him and Dutch. Running is how Schwarzenegger\'s character survives. He runs and falls into the river, covering himself in mud. He backs into a corner, camouflaged thermally. He lets the predator chase him into a trap, which eventually proves the alien\'s undoing.\n\nOf course, there\'s a practical reason for Dutch to retreat: the way power shifts between man and monster makes the scene engaging and tense. It modulates our fear and hope. But it\'s curious how feminine our hero\'s cries are when we hear them from the Predator\'s POV; they\'re high pitched and whimpering. Dutch doesn\'t hide his pain or his fear; in fact he\'s actually the least ostentatiously masculine of all the squadron - his masculinity comes from acting with instinct and knowing the land, not swaggering performance.\n\nTurns out, that\'s the only real masculinity that actually matters.'

###### b'I guess if you were to continue the metaphor: Dutch turns the tables and challenges the predator on its own masculinity. It almost always liked to attack in close range, feeling confident in its invisibility. Dutch becomes invisible himself, and uses that invisibility to sneak attack the Predator and fight in hand to hand combat. '
###### b'I think you can also apply this to the Predator itself. It primarily relies on its technological sophistication to overcome its quarry, yet in the end it is defeated by an oversized version of a dead fall trap, a paleolithic technology. In fact, Arnold counters each of its pieces of technology with a primitive analogue. He uses a bow and arrow instead of a laser, and he uses mud instead of a cloaking system. Lacking its technological advantages, the Predator, even though it is far superior physically to a human, is just as vulnerable to the laws of physics as any other animal. It eschews its tech and wants to prove its superiority by fighting Arnold one on one, but Arnold turns the tables by using a piece of technology that is thousands of years old.'
###### b'These are the types of fan theories that I frequent this subreddit for. Kudos man!'
###### b"Great theory, but I have one question: You say that Hawkins dies first because he is the least masculine (not killing any enemy soldiers, scrawny communications expert). And then you say that Dutch survives because he doesn't adhere to traditional masculinity. \n\nSo despite taking similar roles, why does one die and one live?"
###### b'[removed]'
###### b" Great theory but to make an addition I would say that part of Mac's intimidating factor is that he is quiet. When he threatens to bleed Dillon isn't that because Dillon is being loud as they sneak up on the Guerrilla Camp and thus threatens to give them away? Mac silently sneaks upon him like he silently sneaks up on the camp, silently kills the scorpion, and attempts to silently kill the Predator. This last part is the connection of course and how the Predator kills him with his own masculinity. Mac is a silent killer and while he attempts to sneak up on the predator it is Mac who is snuck up on and killed."
###### b'Fantastic analysis buddy!!'
###### b'As a Native American growing up with this movie. Billy is what we all aspired to become. Just a badass and you dont get those types of Native tropes in movies these days. I remember in old action movies there was always a big Native guy who tested the protagonist in a type of strength show down. Billy and Turok is all we have.'
###### b"This isn't a fan theory, it's a top notch analysis of narrative, character, story and Mise en scene that would be worthy of a serious film magazine or publication.\n\nBloody great work OP."
###### b"Billy's death though. As a kid I thought he was such a damn baller."
###### b"I like it,  but isn't this taking putting ideas into the authors mind,  after the fact,  a little *too* far? \n\nIts more of a fan coincidental observation, than a theory of what artistic effort was put into the movie."
###### b'A lot of thought clearly went into this, and I think it made for an interesting read. Just a few points:\n\nYou stated that Hawkins didn\'t kill anyone during the raid on the palapa, but there are a couple of kills that could be attributed to either Hawkins or \'Poncho\' Ramirez; both of them appear from behind smoke, having gunned down two guerrillas in the foreground, but it *seems like* the muzzle flash is in the wrong position for Ramirez, so it\'s likely Hawkins killed the two men. This is right before both of them get pinned down by two guerrillas from an elevated position, when Hawkins provides suppressing fire that gives Ramirez an opportunity to fire a grenade, so with the above, it\'s not as if he wasn\'t useful during the raid, even if he had the fewest on-screen kills.\n\nHawkins\' bad jokes were meant to add to the character to make him \'distinctive\'; they weren\'t meant to be a \'statement\' about his masculinity. Originally, he had a red beret in addition to the glasses to distinguish him from the rest of the cast, but actor Shane Black discarded the beret. According to Black, the other characters had at least one distinctive line, where he didn\'t, and producer Joel Silver had them thrown into the script after hearing him say them once.\n\nBlain\'s injuries *did* bleed: there\'s an initial shot that leaves him stunned, with blood splattered on him, and the shot that felled him exploded in a sizeable blood fountain, even though the plasma caster cauterised the injury instantly. Also, Blain would have been dragged off like Hawkins if Mac didn\'t see the Predator first.\n\nMac\'s shaving is something Bill Duke came up with as a sort of gag, presumably during early filming, and John McTiernan ended up integrating it into the movie, so I doubt it was meant to \'foreshadow\' his death. Also, Mac\'s death was instantaneous. Bodies twitching after death is *apparently* a thing.\n\nThe log scene where Ramirez gets hit happens pretty fast, and I could see *maybe* one person ducking out of the way, so I\'m not sure it\'s meant to be some kind of irony that he delivers the "You got time to duck?" line. The context doesn\'t quite fit, anyway: there was a delay between Ramirez firing those grenades and their detonation, so he *did* have time to duck. Not so with the fast-moving log.'
###### b"I always thought it was funny how the Predator (AKA the *Yautja*) is supposed to operate on some form of strict code of honor, yet it doesn't mind utilizing superior firepower and stealth tech into a fight."
###### b"I'd say that dutch's only moment of bravado is when he participates in the arm wrestle, and I think it's significant that the predator tries to beat him to death with raw strength.\nIf Dutch had continued to fight the predator, he would have been killed in the same symbolic way as his teammates.\n\nBut instead he abandons his bravado and runs (and crawls) away, using his weakness to draw the predator into a trap. Accepting the limits of his masculinity is what lets him win."
###### b"I enjoyed this theory so much, it's a shame the Predator didn't vanquish Dutch by beheading him with a high-tension wire disguised in monkey poop i.e. kill him with a shitty one-liner.  "

## [Harry Potter] Someone's death was already spoiled in the third movie
#### b"So we all know Dumbledore dies in the sixth movie. But there are hints that his death was already spoiled in the third movie. \n\nThere is a christmas dinner with various people involved. Finally Sibyll Trelawny joins the party. Before she sits down she is frightened because  there are already 12 people sitting at the table and 13 people sitting at the same table brings misery. She does not sit down and mentiones that the first of those 13 persons to stand up would die. \n\nIn order to calm her, Dumbledore stands up and leaves the table. \nBut we later get to know that Ron's rat was just Peter Pattigrew who transformeed himself. Knowing that Ron carried his rat in his pocket most of the time, that'd mean there were already 13 people at the table. \nAs Dumbledore leaves as the first of those 13 people, his fate was sealed.\n\n\n**edit:** Thanks for the gold !"

###### b'Back in the day that was called foreshadowing, not a spoiler. '
###### b"There IS a reference to Dumbledore's death in the third movie that is NOT a scene in the book!\n\nAfter the quidditch scene, when Harry gets chased around the pitch by the dementors and eventually falls off his broom, there's a scene in the hospital wing. \n\nThe screen is black because Harry's still passed out, but we can hear Ron and Fred/George's voices. \n\nRON: Looks a bit peaky, doesnt he? \n\nFRED: Peaky? What d'you expect him to look like? He fell fifty feet.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come out looking.\n\nWhere does Dumbledore meet his demise in HBP? The astronomy tower."

###### b"I thought this was pretty well established. This is foreshadowing btw, hardly really spoiling. When first reading PoA, there's no reason to assume there is even a shred of truth to what Trelawny is saying in this scene."
###### b"Well I mean, he would've been the first to die even if he wasn't murdered. He's old as fuck compared to anyone else at that table. "
###### b'This one has been popular for a while. Good theory anyways'
###### b"Spoilers aren't the same thing as foreshadowing"
###### b"I'm sorry but this is so old."

###### b"I'm pretty sure that scene wasn't in the movie"
###### b'Dumbledore dies!? '
###### b'Did that scene happen in the movie? Think this should be referring to the books. Pedantic of me maybe '
###### b'So he was cursed to die... 3 years later?\n\nI could say the same thing about you and I would still be correct if you died 90 years from now.'
###### b"He was also the oldest of them by a large margin. It's very logical to assume he will die first. I think this would be exact reason why superstition exists. When most expected result happens, but they relate it to some superstitious stuff. \n\nIt only needs to happen once for people to be convinced it that there is a relation between the two events and spread the superstition even further."
###### b"Guys!  In the books, Dumbledore *doesn't get up first.* Harry and Ron do."

## Back to the Future - the rape of Lorraine at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance was always part of the original timeline and Marty/George stopped it
#### b'Perhaps it would not have played our exactly as it did with Marty in the car trying to park it, but I definitely can see George walking away when confronted by a drunk Biff, and allowing Lorraine to go through what he stopped him from doing to her with Martys help.\n\nWhen we first see Lorraine she\'s an alcoholic, depressed woman trying to make it through the days. She may have been repressed sexually, but has clearly had some trauma around dating and boys as she will not let her daughter even talk to a boy, let alone date. She doesn\'t like Martys girl because she represents the type of girl she was before the incident with Biff and is "forward". A classic sign of sexual trauma \n\nShe brings up the dance as she pours herself a drink of straight vodka as she remembers the night and details. As she tells it she remembers the only positive part of the night, the kiss she had with George, a man too feeble and weak to do anything like Biff could do. George however is lost in the television, literally dissociating from conversation because it\'s traumatic for him too, he failed to protect his wife from Biff.\n\nFurther evidence, OT Lorraine is never in the same scene as OT Biff after the dance, like when Biff arrives at the house after school with the car busted up. George, who works, and the children are all home but Lorraine is not. Biff laughs and says say hi to your mother for me, before leaving, further rubbing salt into that old wound. When Marty allows George to stand up and protect Lorraine instead of doing so himself, Lorraine undergoes a miraculous personality change in the future... With the direct intervention in changing George\'s personality it should not have altered Lorraine\'s personality so much as this erasing of a trauma would. She used to be fun loving and a bit of a party girl. Unknowingly, Marty protects his mother from a sexual assault that would have traumatized her.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold! Please contact 800.656.HOPE (4673) if you need to talk to someone 24/7 confidentially about your experiences with sexual assault. '

###### b'Yes, exactly. Which would also explain why she married George from the beginning, because she knew he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t overpower her or hurt her. '
###### b'I think that while it really fits with adult Loraine\'s behavior, i.e the drinking, overall appearance of apathy and depression, and projection onto her daughter and Jennifer, a couple details in your summary are off from what occurred in the film.  I actually watched a marathon over the weekend with my nephew who had not seen them, so it\'s fresh in my mind.\n\nAnyway, Lorraine remembered the name of the dance. When she got to that point in the story of her and George\'s romance, her daughter sarcastically interrupted to finish the story as if she\'d heard it a thousand times and she is the one who called it the fish under the sea dance. Lorraine corrected her about the actual name.\n\nLorraine actually had perfect recall of the night, even referencing the lightning that would send Marty home in his version of 1955 by saying that the dance was on the night of "that terrible thunderstorm." One could argue that she had perfect recall because it was the night she and the love of her life, who was an entirely unexpected suitor for her, fell in love, but she doesn\'t seem all that thrilled about their adult lives so maybe there was more at play there. Potential something traumatic.\n\nI think the confusion you\'re thinking of was regarding what George was doing in the tree when he fell and got hit by the car.  George being checked out of the conversation could be, in part, because of that, given that he was in the tree peeping on Lorraine and she was none the wiser even all those years later, thinking he was bird watching, as was probably his claim.  \n\nAnyway, still a solid theory.'
###### b'This is too perfect to not be what the script was going for. This would be better posted in r/moviedetails. '
###### b'I always thought that was spelled out perfectly. Bttf is considered the perfect script in the screenwriting circle.'
###### b'Honestly this is what I thought after I watched the movie again as an adult. Her actions before kind of went in line with somebody who experienced and never processed severe trauma. \n\nEven Biff\'s actions before the dance "I\'m not that kinda girl" "Maybe you are and you don\'t know it yet" Fall in line with somebody working up to assault. He\'s trying to rationalize it so he can finally do it with a clear conscious (in his mind)   \n\n'
###### b"I just watched it for the first time the other day and i was surprised how much is in this movie. It's a wealth of fantheories potential so I hope this wasn't posted before. "
###### b"My question has always been: Why in the hell would the McFly's (of the end of movie) hire Biff to detail their cars? This is still the same man, although altered from George's punch, that tormented George and attempted to rape Lorraine. "
###### b"I watched this movie this weekend because the trilogy is on HBO Now and also had a realization I wanted to share.   \n  \nMarty being able to perform with the band at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance after Marvin Berry injures his hand is an extremely important and rewarding scene for Marty because he actually gets to perform at his high school after being rejected by Huey Lewis and the rest of the talent show committee in the first act.   \n  \nIt's why he loses control of himself - in the moment he's so excited to perform and showcase his talent he forgets he's performing in the 50's and not performing at the talent show he'd been practicing to audition for so long. "
###### b'I totally buy this theory, but just wanted to point out one tiny error: it was the daughter who thought it was the "Fish under the Sea" dance, and Lorraine immediately corrects her.'
###### b"There's too many variables in the story to figure out what originally happened. From the moment Marty gets hit with the car instead of George, everything changes. She was supposed to fall in love with George like she did Calvin and go to the dance with him where they kiss but that's pretty much all we know. The only reason the altercation with Biff happens is because he came looking for Marty after the manure incident, and we know this because he states it to Marty. He wasn't looking for Lorraine, she just happened to be there. Interesting theory nonetheless."
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"I don't think so. Remember, Lorraine being in the car with Marty was just a ruse designed to make George look good. If Marty never came back to 1955, then their scheme would have never have happened and the scenario she describes at dinner would have played out as she said. Lorraine's dad would have hit George with the car, she would have felt sorry for him and agreed to go to the dance with him, and they would probably be exchanging awkward conversation in the gym around the time drunk Biff wanders into the parking lot.\n\nOne could also theorize that Biff wouldn't have even been in the parking lot at all at that time, had Marty not come back. It's likely he was there for the purposes of finding Marty and getting retribution for the manure truck incident. Had that never happened, Biff probably would have been in the dance with his flunkies, spiking the punch along with them. \n\n"
###### b"I've seen this movie a hundred times but never made that connection. Great job."
###### b'It\'s a decent theory.  Except,  Lorraine falls in love with George when he gets hit by the car.  Which gets upended by Calvin Klein.  Producing the icky mom/ son love interest. \n\nThereby moving when/ how Lorraine gets to the dance. Her being late/in the parking lot is due to Calvin interrupting the time line. \n\n However,  that in and of itself doesn\'t clear that it happened. \n\nEXCEPT what finally triggered George to stand up to Biff was seeing Lorraine in dire trouble.  That\'s completely the same regardless of timeline. Remember,  Calvin tried multiple times to get him to assert himself.  But only in that n one situation did it hold. \n\nAka he\'d never had someone to fight for.  Not even himself. \n\nAlso Lorraine lovingly talks about the night and repeats ad nauseam.\n\nHer change in personality is due to George\'s change in personality.  She didn\'t have to "acquiese" to escapism George.  Instead she got to stay herself with a man who now valued himself.\n\nAlso Biff still says the line in 2 in the altered timeline. \n\nHowever,  rapist Biff shows up in bttf2 as Donald Trump in alternate future.

###### b"This isn't a fan theory, this is part of the actual plot."

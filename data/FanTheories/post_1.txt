## The entire movie of Aladdin was simply the fulfillment of his first wish.
#### b'Something that always bothered and confused me about Disney\'s Aladdin was the ease at which he could suddenly "not be a prince" at several points in the movie, despite the fact he has specifically wished to be a prince. If I wish for 3 arms, do I not have 3 arms? it was a thorn in my side it what has always a Disney classic in my heart.\n\n\nThe other day I was watching the movie for the first time in many years, and the truth struck me like a thunderbolt: **Aladdin did not wish to BE a prince, he wished for the Genie to MAKE him a prince. Everything that transpires after Aladdin has made his first wish was simply the Genie (using his omni-potent powers to pull the strings behind the scenes) fulfilling Aladdin\'s wish to be made into a prince. At the end of the movie, he marries a princess. He now IS a prince. The Genie\'s work is NOW completed.** The dudes at Disney clearly had some blade runner level shit going on when they wrote the script.\n\n\nThe Genie states several times in the movie that his powers are both phenomenal and cosmic, virtually omnipotent and only restricted by a few rules. **He also states he can see at least one million years into the future.**  (certainly at least to the invention of automobiles) Dressing Aladdin up, giving him an elephant and a parade to make a fantastic entrance into Agrabah are **simply means to an end.** The reality is Aladdin doesn\'t even want to be a Prince, he just wants Jasmine. **When the Genie\'s mission is about to succeed Aladdin suddenly gets cold feet. The Genie -seeing into the future- allows his lamp to be stolen by Jafar and the hijinks that ensue because he knows that Aladdin\'s heroic efforts to set things right will convince the Sultan to change the law, and thus let Aladdin marry Jasmine, and Aladdin will then BECOME A PRINCE.** Aladdin doesn\'t even have a choice, he can\'t "undo" his wish, the wish was made and magical contract bound.\n\n\nWhat the genie is doing can easily be seen after Jafar is banished to the cave of wonders at the end of the movie. Everything goes back to the way it was, everything Jafar did was undone, people, objects and animals un-transform. The palace magically teleport\'s from the mountain back to the city.  Did it ever really move? Did someone magically wish for all these things to be undone? **The Genie\'s knows his ultimate mission is nearing it\'s conclusion. So he resets the sideshow, the purpose of which was to convince the Sultan Aladdin should be a prince and make Aladdin rise to his inevitable royal promotion, both in spirit and mind.** The Sultan, clearly traumatized at crackers forcibly inserted into his mouth for hours on end (in some kind of pseudo-sexual prison nightmare) would happily make a homeless thief the next ruler in place of Jafar. It\'s an experience so disturbing he instantly rewrites the very laws his culture is founded upon. The Genie needs to demonstrate that true worth lies within-a Diamond in the Rough. These length\'s were necessary since Mind Control, Murder and Resurrection are the three things the Genie can never do. The truth is nobodies life was ever even in real danger. **The Genie has been using his mystic Machiavellian scheme since minute one to set Aladdin up as a prince. Jafar\'s wishes were meaningless, he was a pawn in a greater game.** \n\nThe second Aladdin made his first wish Jafar was doomed-Jafar was in the Genie\'s way. The Genie is omniscient and used this rivalry to position Aladdin into prince-hood. After Jafar\'s part had been played out the Genie had no more use for him, since the Genie can\'t kill, the Genie did the next best thing and buried his sorry ass in a cave for ten thousand years. Think about the magnitude of that amount of time, it\'s a fate worse then death. The Genie is an unstoppable engine of destruction on a mission to fulfill Aladdin\'s wish by any means necessary.\n\nWe must also look at Aladdin\'s wish very carefully. He does not wish to "BE" a prince. He wishes for the Genie to "MAKE" ***(by force if necessary)*** him a prince.  **Aladdin may actually be aware of whats really happening the whole movie.**  This is first hint we have of this is scene in the palace Garden with the Genie. Aladdin\'s basically asking the Genie how to make Jasmine fall for him, and the Genies advice is to "Tell her the TRUTH". What truth? That hes a street rat? But didn\'t he wish to be a prince? Is he not NOW a prince? If I was Aladdin I would have thrown this in the Genies face. But Aladdin doesn\'t. Perhaps this is a sign that **Aladdin, the clever little devil he is, knows what game is being played, and that he is not a real prince yet.** (on many occasions, such as deceiving the Genie into a free wish, tricking Jafar ect. Aladdin proves his main attribute is his quick mind)\n\n\n**When the immortal Genie lays the sad news on Aladdin he can\'t make someone fall in love with him, Aladdin\'s dexterous and cunning human brain works furiously to find a way around it. So he has a genius stroke. He wishes for the Genie to make him a prince. The creation of a kingdom has not been wished for, only that Aladdin is made a prince. And what a coincidence: the closest kingdom\'s princess just happens to be Aladdin\'s dream girl. Aladdin knows what he really wants, as does the Genie, and perhaps as a reward for Aladdin\'s cleverness and out of geographic and language restrictions, the Genie has no choice but to make Aladdin the prince of Agrabah. Well played, Aladdin. Well played.**\n\n\n**Edit 1: **People seem to be really hung up on the seeing events/into the future genie powers. Thats really not the point I\'m trying to make. The genie could just have easily implanted the whole action/adventure lamp stealing nonsense into the minds of the main characters to bring about the ending (thus the castle magically reappearing-did it even move?) The point I\'m trying to make is the genie was in control, plain and simple, and the ending proves it.\n\n**Edit 2:** In trying to see if other people had stumbled upon this, I ran into a lot of lame theories that the Genie had traveled back in time to make Aladdin\'s father the prince of thieves. This is all nonsense  because they are based off direct to video sequels written long after the original movie. As far as I\'m concerned, the journey of Aladdin and the Genie is the story Disney wanted to tell: Everything that transpired between Aladdin\'s first wish and to the end of the movie was expertly orchestrated by the Genie to make him in to a prince, as he was commanded to do. I don\'t think the Genie is evil, he is a fun loving, free spirited demi-god. Hes slighty insane because anyone trapped alone in a cave for eons would be.* **He had a job to do, with the promise of freedom from an eternity of slavery as payment no less.**'

###### b'[](/treehuggerhey)Interestingly, a lot of theories of this nature hinge around the protagonists of the film being played for fools. (The Darth Jar Jar theory is a great example of this.)\n\nBut in this theory, Aladdin is actually the one doing the playing... which fits in with his characterization from the very beginning. He uses his wits to make his way around the world, even around those who are far stronger or more powerful than he is.\n\nI kind of like this!'
###### b"I like this theory.  By going the long way around with the shenanigans the genie not only fulfills Aladdin's First wish, but preemptively fulfills all of the wishes he might make in order to win Jasmine's heart.  So, the genie gets to spend a longer period of time free from the lamp working on Aladdin's real wish AND preserves Aladdin's other two wishes so he increases his odds of ending up free."
###### b"> The Genie is an unstoppable engine of destruction on a mission to fulfill Aladdin's wish by any means necessary.\n\nSo... the Genie is a Meeseeks?\n\nHe is blue."
###### b'So remember how Genie saves Al and basically uses up one wish, just because his head fell forward? I think Genie gave him another freebie and tricked Al at the end by asking him to wish for denial (Sounds like The Nile) to which he replies "No Way!" So he fulfilled the third wish that Al didn\'t think he even had. '
###### b'Aladdin is on Light Yagami levels. All according to keikaku.'
###### b'The entire movie is a con man trying to sell a rusty lamp'
###### b"I know this is a picky detail, but Aladdin and Jasmine don't get married in that movie. They get married in the third movie. "
###### b'One of the best quality fan theories on this sub for a while'
###### b"The term, here, is [outcome pump](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/).\n\nAn omnipotent genie doesn't have to solve your problem by working *forward* from the current moment to the goal; they can simply work *backward* from all the branches of time they can see where the goal was achieved, to the present."
###### b"Wasn't it clear that Aladdin only wanted to be a prince to get with Jasmin?"
###### b'Excellent theory, and about a classic, no less.\n\nThat always bothered me too.  Even as a kid, once he wished to be a prince, I thought, "Well, was his dad a king now?  Does he have a kingdom?"  \n\nBeing a prince has to do with your circumstances, it isn\'t something that someone can just become because of a parade and a few elephants.  Your theory would patch up this inconsistency.\n\nI don\'t, however, want to think about Robin Williams or any of his characters in a negative light.  So 0/10. /s'

###### b'You could have written a critical analysis essay on this instead of a reddit comment, but I guess more people will see this'
###### b'Very well written theory. Much more cohesive and logical than a lot of the theories I have read'

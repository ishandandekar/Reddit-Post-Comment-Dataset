## In the 1971 Willy Wonka Charlie was given the Golden Ticket on purpose.
#### b'OK we are led to believe that all the golden tickets have been found. The news reported from Paraguay. Gene Wilder actually plays the reporter who relays the news that the last ticket has been found so we can easily make the assumption that the reporter is actually Wonka and he intentionally fabricated the report. Why? He wanted somebody to find the last ticket the pure way, not just as part of the contest to win the lifetime supply of chocolate. He also wanted somebody local for many reasons. It would be much more likely for a child to be able to stay and move his entire family into the factory if he/she was local. Also if the last kid was local there would be no logistics of getting him/her to the factory because the event was just a day away. Now lets look at how Charlie gets the ticket. He finds money and goes into the candy store run by Bill (oddly another form of William and Willy). This theory has Bill working for Wonka.  We know he likes kids and gives them free candy....lots of it..as seen in the opening Candy Man number. But you say \'Wonka has only Oompa Loomps working for him\'. Not true. Remember Slugworth? At the end Wonka even admits to Charlie "He Works For Me". So we know he employs humans as double agents. Bill gives the kids candy and sells it as well. He reports to Wonka about everything. Wonka instructs Bill to give the last ticket to a local kid, a poor kid, an unselfish kid. Bill probably already knows these things about Charlie but just need to confirm them. When Charlie comes in with his found money Bill offers him a Slugworth or a Wonka. Charlie says "whichever is biggest". So he gets the Wonka. Then as Charlie is walking out he says to Bill "I also want to get one for my Grandpa Joe"...that is the clincher. Bill HAS to give the ticket today because the event is tomorrow. Charlie NEVER gets to choose what candy to buy grandpa Joe. Bill says \'here, try a traditional Wonka bar this time\' and grabs one. He doesn\'t grab one from the stack as an owner would, he takes the display one and hands it to Charlie. He knew exactly which one had the ticket. It was displayed right out front but behind the counter so it could only be retrieved by him. Also (and this might be a bit of a stretch) when Wonka meets the kids he acts like this is the first he has heard of any of them....until he gets to Charlie and he says "I read all about you in the papers". He didn\'t say anything like this about any of the other kids. Could the "papers" he is talking about be a report from Bill?\n\nEDIT: Wow. thank you so much for the kind words and the gold! Appreciated.\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people are saying the Paraguay reporter was not played by Wilder. This may be correct. However I swear I saw that in some reputable place a few years back and thought it was common knowledge. It is true that the actor who played that particular reporter isn\'t listed anywhere. Either way the theory still holds.\n'

###### b'Just to add some fuel to the fire, my girlfriend recently directed an official stage adaptation of "Charlie & the Chocolate Factory" which combines elements of the original book and the movie.  In the notes from the company it suggests that the Candy Man (the guy who gives Charlie the winning bar) be played by the same actor playing Wonka, with a strong implication that he very intentionally gave Charlie the last ticket.\n\nEdit: Found [this](http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_w/WillyWonka.html) which looks to be the same description that I\'m referring to if you read "Willy Wonka/Candy Man" under "Cast", if /u/paulvs88 needed further proof.'
###### b'I was extremely skeptical from the title, and am very impressed. Thorough, clear, and most importantly plausible. I love it!'
###### b'This actually seems really plausible. Well done.'
###### b"Which reporter do you think is played by Gene Wilder? I just watched the scene back and can't find one that could be him. Can't find any info about that online either? I like your theory and I'm not trying to poke holes in it, I'm just super curious if Gene did play someone, that would be really cool."
###### b'This is great stuff, but I think you need some kind of a reason why Wonka bothers with the golden ticket competition in the first place.\n\nI think there are at least two reasonable explanations. The first is that Wonka was aware of Charlie from the beginning and the entire events of the movie was an elaborate test to see if Charlie specifically was a worthy successor.\n\nThe second I can think of is that Wonka had originally planned to use the competition to find a successor, but was more familiar with the other winners than he pretended and had already decided they were not suitable, including the kid in Paraguay who was in fact a legitimate winner. After claiming the Paraguayan winner had forged their golden ticket, he planted a final ticket in the local candy store and gave Bill his instructions.'
###### b"Good suppporting evidence but I always thought it was pretty clear from the focus on the Candy Man's attention and the lingering shots in that scene. \n\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Slugworth waiting for Charlie on his way home immediately after winning the ticket? How would he be in position without knowing in advance where the last ticket was and who would win and what path they would take?  \n\nI can't remember if the Gobstopper offer is right then or later."
###### b"An integral part of your theory is Charlie's locality, namely that the final planted ticket could only go to a local kid so they had time to attend the event the next day. But...\n\nHow do you explain the fact Slugworth, one of Wonka's double-agents, is at the press conferences of all the kids, which we know by the fact he secretly bribes them all? How is it possible that he could show up in all these places right on time unless... all of the tickets were planted by design? \n\nIt's been my interpretation that Wonka intentionally planted all of the tickets so that he could have something of a social experiment among a bunch of kids and guardians who embody the seven deadly sins. Charlie, who represents Envy, is the only one who resolves his sinful ways, which is what shows him to be most worthy in Wonka's opinion. "
###### b"Wait... So this is exactly as I thought the movie was supposed to be understood. No necessarily all the detail, just that the candy man Bill gives Charlie the ticket on purpose. It's his task to give a ticket to the most deserving. I had no idea, having never read the book, that this isn't cannon. Good on you for bringing this up!"
###### b'I always thought this was part of the plan.\n\nWilly Wonka knew about Charlie. He wanted to retire and give the factory to some one good and who was similar to him. The whole Golden ticket was just a ruse, so he can easily hand the company over.'
###### b'So shines a good theory in a weary subreddit. '
###### b"When I saw the movie when I was a kid, I remember thinking that it was somewhat implausible that one of those tickets would be found in the chocolate factory's home town. He sent the chocolate all over the world, but one ticket happened to stay local? Your post has made me realize that it happened that way because Wonka wanted it that way. He wanted a local kid to have a shot at becoming his heir, and maybe even chose Harry in advance through some unexplained process. That really makes sense. \n\nThis is one of the best Fan Theories I've read here. "
###### b"To be honest i never thought that this wasn't the case."
###### b"Willy Wonka is Charlie's father."
###### b">Gene Wilder actually plays the reporter who relays the news that the last ticket has been found so we can easily make the assumption that the reporter is actually Wonka and he intentionally fabricated the report\n\nWhat? That's not him.\n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/aveleyman/images/2/27/Unknown_as_Paraguayan_Newscaster.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20170316161829"

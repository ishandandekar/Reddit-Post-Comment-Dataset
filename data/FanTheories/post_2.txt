## Why Steve Rogers was able to resist Thanos.
#### b'I\'m referring to at 0:33 in this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pd0Pk5av2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pd0Pk5av2s)\n\nThanos moves his glove hand towards Rogers, and Rogers stops it with both hands. Thanos strains a bit more, but is unable to move his hand forward or close his grip, so he just knocks Rogers out with his non-glove hand instead.\n\nIf you look at his facial expression, he looks shocked at 0:34 upon the initial block, then at 0:38 onwards he looks really perplexed with his eyes squinting and all, like he\'s thinking "how is this guy able to do this"? But what is \'*this*\' that Rogers is doing?\n\nI don\'t believe it\'s *physically* blocking Thanos\' hand. Thanos beat up Hulk, and Rogers is definitely not stronger than Hulk, not to mention Thanos knocks out Rogers seconds later, while Rogers\' uppercut punch at 0:30 did nothing to Thanos.\n\nThe glove works by responding to the will of the user, and in that moment, both of them were in physical contact with the glove. So Rogers was kind of "out-willing" Thanos, and while none of the infinity stones were actively being used, they were implicitly responding to both Thanos\' and Rogers\' wills respectively, with Rogers\' influence being greater. And that\'s how he was able to resist Thanos.'

###### b"I like this! Ties into his being able to almost move Thor's hammer in AOU. You should post it to the Infinity War sub!"
###### b'Also the gems look HUGE in that scene'
###### b'This might actually be canon from the comics, OP. In Infinity War (or Infinity Gauntlet, can\xe2\x80\x99t remember which) Magus, Adam Warlock\xe2\x80\x99s negative, has the Infinity Gauntlet with all the stones. \n\nWarlock goes to fight him and puts his hand on the Gauntlet and says something along the lines of, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find Infinity well remembers my touch.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they duel for who gets to possess the Gauntlet which Warlock eventually wins even though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the one wearing the Gauntlet. \n\nSo, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s more to this than I initially thought.'
###### b"It's like how Cap was able to sort of jiggle Mjolnir. He wasn't quite worthy, but he was close. Not because of the strength of his arms, but because of the strength of his heart."
###### b'For those saying Cap couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lift Mjolnir due to lies with Tony that came out in Civil War, I had read somewhere (don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly where) that Cap is not worthy due to his greatest fear (shown in AOU with Scarlet Witch playing with minds) being the war being over. Someone truly worthy would want any wars to end (In original Thor Thor isn\xe2\x80\x99t worthy per Odin because he wants war and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t until he is ready to sacrifice everything without his power to save the Earth that he\xe2\x80\x99s worthy again).'
###### b'Of all the marvel theories over the last few weeks, this is one I like the best'
###### b"Yes! This theory makes sense. I wonder if the power of Uru metal is intrinsically linked to the users character. That's just over if it's properties and why Asgardians use that metal opposed to others ( they probably knew Vibranium existed in Earth). Kind of makes you think twice of Thanos comment about the hardest choices require the strongest wills. And like OP said, Rogers will matched Thanos will 1:1 at that moment."
###### b'I like this theory'
###### b'So if Steve Rodgers were to try, he could have removed the glove if he thought to?'
###### b'While I like the thinking on display here, I don\'t feel like it\'s what was intended with this scene.\n\nWhen Thanos fights Hulk, he starts out by striking at specific points, presumably pressure points or places where he assumes vital organs would be. It\'s all for the purpose of weakening Hulk right off the bat, because Thanos probably knows of his reputation as the great gladiator of Sakaar, or at least learned about Hulk from The Other after the fiasco Loki caused on earth.\n\nAs far as Thanos might know, this blonde human guy, is just a military strategist and leader. There\'s not great tales of Steve Rogers and his amazing feats of strength. He starts fighting him on the same "easy mode" setting he\'s just used for all these earth people. So when this puny human blocks his hand mid strike, Thanos is momentarily taken aback like "Wow, this is way stronger than humans are supposed to be."'
###### b'This is my head canon now, makes so much sense.'
###### b'"I like this one"'
###### b'I like it but I think it was just Thanos playing around and getting surprised at how Cap was way stronger than he expected. More like "is this dude serious?" kinda thing.'
###### b'in my head cannon, Thanos actually kills cap with that head punch but he comes back when thanos uses the time stone moments later'
###### b'What was that Doctor Strange line?\n\n"You\'ll find our will to be stronger"'

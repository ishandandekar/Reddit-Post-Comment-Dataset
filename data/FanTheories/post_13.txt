# r/FanTheories
## In Kung Fu Panda, Tai Lung the villain was never denied the scroll or his destiny of being the dragon warrior. The denying of the scroll to him was just a test, he was supposed to accept the denial with humility. At that point, he would have proven his humility and been granted the scroll.
#### b'To test whether an acolyte was worthy of completing their training, the dojo will deny an acolyte the scroll at the end to test what kind of person they really are. If an acolyte had truly learned the art of balance and inner peace in addition to his physical training, he would have accepted the denial with humility. In doing so, the acolyte would then prove that he is perfect inside and out, and at that point, the master would then explain that it was just a test and grant him the scroll.\n\nTai Lung failed this test by reacting with anger and hatred. That was why he was never granted the scroll: not because he was not worthy, but because he proved himself unworthy. For all his prowess, tai lung failed the most important test in the end, the test of whether he could exercise his great power with great responsibility. \n\nThis was clearly hinted strongly by the movie by the fact that the scroll was empty.'

###### b'This is why Kungfu Panda was an amazing movie. Beyond the fantastic voice acting, the beautiful artwork and cinematography, the enveloping music, the exciting/hilarious action scenes, there was an incredibly clever story.\n\n"There is no secret ingredient" is more profound than its weaker alternative "the power was inside you all along". It\'s not saying you\'re actually special, and you just needed to believe in yourself. Yes, belief in one\'s self was part of it, but the specific lack of a \'secret ingredient\' gives the story new value.\n\nBecause the scroll isn\'t actually empty. It\'s reflective. It\'s shiny enough that you see a reflection of yourself, and what you get at the end of the journey towards becoming the Dragon Warrior is everything you\'ve become to get there.\n\nLiterally \'it\'s about the journey, not the destination\'.\n\nThere is no real Dragon Warrior that is prophesied, but rather a series of potential students given different incentives, and who form their journey in their own unique ways. For brevity, we won\'t go over each of the Furious 5, but just Tigress, Po, and of course Tai Lung.\n\nTai Lung was obvious in how he failed his journey. He failed to handle rejection. I don\'t even think Master Oogway specifically knew that Tai Lung *wasn\'t* the Dragon Warrior, but rather had told him what he needed to hear.\n\nTai Lung was doted on a bit, by Master Shifu. But Oogway knew that if Tai Lung just got everything he wanted, he would be a bad Dragon Warrior. So he denied him the title, and gave him a chance to be better. To really earn it.\n\nAnd he failed.\n\nHe spent 20 years turning toxic and bitter about it. Which is revealed to him in the reflection at the end. All that was left for him was the journey he chose along the way: turning his back on his master, 20 years wasted in prison, and nothing to show for it.\n\nTigress wasn\'t so sad a journey, and she didn\'t get a reveal moment where she gets to see her reflection on the scroll, but it\'s still an important story. She was denied affection by Shifu. We saw this in flashbacks. It\'s what made her so tough; tough love.\n\nShifu praises Tai Lung at every turn, and look how he turned out. So Shifu adjusted his teaching style, possibly on purpose, but more likely as an overcorrection to what happened with his greatest failure; Tai Lung.\n\nSo he gave Tigress none of the praise she was looking for. We see this again in the first fight scene we see with the Furious 5 and Shifu, where he congratulates them on being disappointing. A funny line, for sure, but kind of a dick move by a teacher. Shifu wasn\'t just saying "I\'m disappointed", which is a tough enough message to hear. He went further by intentionally building it up by implying he was actually proud of them, for once. And then he snuffed that dream out and reminded them that they\'re not good enough for him (in their minds, not as good as Tai Lung).\n\nTigress is then rejected again by Oogway, which makes her abandon her master as well. This is at least a little different than Tai Lung, as she is accompanied by her teammates to make a final stand against Tai Lung. But they didn\'t have the secret ingredient.\n\nWhich is not actually nothing, by the way. It\'s self-reflection. They were a bit more focused on their own teamwork and ability than in teaching Tai Lung (which is totally understandable. I don\'t really consider this a character flaw, more like a current state of being for them: focused upon their own training and cohesion).\n\nSo they are defeated, because they hadn\'t completed their journeys yet, either. They needed self-reflection as well.\n\nPo is the goddamn best. He\'s the perfect non-standard protagonist, in my opinion. He\'s not physically gifted. He doesn\'t come from some important lineage (at least not until Kungfu Panda 2, but I haven\'t actually gotten around to seeing that one yet, so I don\'t know how important his heritage is). He\'s just a kungfu geek with a dream.\n\nI won\'t recap the whole journey for Po with you, but the important parts are that his determination reignites a flame inside of Shifu to be a better teacher. Shifu reforms his teaching style to match the student, instead of the other way around (like how he taught with Tai Lung and Tigress). Then Po makes his journey, is given the gift of self-reflection, and has fun using what he\'s learned to become the Dragon Warrior, defeat Tai Lung, and bring peace to his master.\n\nWhen people talk about timeless comedies, this movie needs to come up more often.'
###### b"In that sense Tigress also didn't prove herself worthy of being the dragon warrior, since she also could not handle her rejection well. "
###### b"Kung Fu Panda has some of the most important lessons you can learn in life.\n\nOne often meets one's destiny on the path one takes to avoid it.\n\nYesterday is history, tomorrow a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.\n\nAnd of course, most importantly:\n\nThere is no secret ingredient."
###### b'It makes sense why Po earned it then, because from the very beginning he never thought he was worthy of it. '
###### b'Makes a lot of sense. Also sounds a lot better than "Oogway just somehow knew Tai Lung was evil inside."'
###### b'Given or not, the scroll was still a character-revealing device.  Anyone would step forward to defend the valley if they believed that a scroll was going to grant them the power to do so.  Po had the scroll, which granted him nothing, and still chose to defend the valley.  Tai Lung was denied the scroll, which he believed would grant him everything, and chose to forsake the valley.'
###### b'Reasons why Kung Fu Panda is the best \n\n1. Jack mf Black \n\n2. Great quotes like \xe2\x80\x9cone often meets his destiny on the road he takes trying to avoid it\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe past is history, the future is a mystery, but today is a gift. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s called the present\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n3. Kung Fu Fighting by Cee Lo featuring Jack Black fuckin SLAPS '
###### b'Take a seat, young Lung'
###### b"I feel like Tai Lung can be forgiven, because he was some random orphan who had no choice in the matter of going through this lifetime of training. He was sort of forced into, almost assured from the beginning he would be this fancy Dragon Warrior, and then denied the opportunity. \n\nPo was just some random idiot who never thought himself as being important or worthy of anything. Even if he was denied the opportunity to be the Dragon Warrior, even though he really wanted it, he'd probably just be happy to be a bad ass kung-fu fighter.\n\nI felt really bad for Tai Lung, because it's made clear at the end of the movie that his hatred is, largely, Shifu's fault. "
###### b'This honestly makes the message better '
###### b'When Po opens the Dragon Scroll and sees nothing, only the empty surface, does he not thereby confirm Lacan\xe2\x80\x99s thesis that objet a is a lure, a stand-in for the void in the very heart of the symbolic order, that it has no positive ontological consistency? When Lacan proposes as the formula of fantasy $ \xe2\x97\x8a a, does he not thereby indicate that objet a is ultimately the fantasmatic object? The elementary operation of fantasy is the belief in the actual positive existence of objet a, of the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial ingredient,\xe2\x80\x9d the quintessence, the sublime \xe2\x80\x9cfifth elements\xe2\x80\x9d over and above the ordinary four ones (earth, fire, water, air), so when Po realizes that \xe2\x80\x9c/t/here is no special ingredient. It\xe2\x80\x99s only you. To make something special you just have to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s special,\xe2\x80\x9d does he thereby not accomplish a kind of wild traversee du fantasme, breaking out of its spell?\n\nThere are effectively some surprisingly complex moments in Kung Fu Panda. When Po enters the forbidden hall in which the Dragon Scroll is kept, he sees a precious sacred painting and exclaims with awe: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen paintings of this painting\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 an authentic Platonic moment, with its reference to the distinction between copy and copy of a copy\xe2\x80\xa6 Furthermore, there is an interesting moment of psychological (and narrative) vacillation in the big confrontation between Shifu and Tai Lung: aware of his responsibility for Tai Lung\xe2\x80\x99s failure to become a Master, Shifu apologizes to him, confessing how, out of his love for Tai Lung, he blinded himself for the dangerous path Tai Lung was taking and thus helped his downfall. At this moment, Tai Lung\xe2\x80\x99s expression changes: he looks at Shifu with a perplexed gaze mixed with sympathy, taken aback, and we (the spectators) are led to believe that a moment of authentic existential contact took place between Shifu and Tai Lung, well beyond the simplistic confrontation of the good and evil hero\xe2\x80\xa6 however, the moment passes quickly and Tai Lung explodes in rage, ferociously attacking again the paternal figure of Shifu. It is as if, at the level of the narrative logic, Shifu makes the offer to Tai Lung \xe2\x80\x9cLet us change the rules and move from stupid cartoon confrontation to authentic drama!\xe2\x80\x9d, the offer which is rejected by his opponent.\n\nSo, again \xe2\x80\x93 is the film\xe2\x80\x99s insight into the illusory nature of the object-cause of desire, into the primacy of void over every object that occupies the place of void, effectively proto-Lacanian? It is \xe2\x80\x93 IF we misread Lacan\xe2\x80\x99s notion of \xe2\x80\x9ctraversing the fantasy\xe2\x80\x9d as a new version of traditional wisdom. That is to say, what is wisdom at its most elementary? In the film, it is embodied in the old tortoise Oogway \xe2\x80\x93 the ultimate wisdom is: there is no objet a, no quintessence, every object of our desire is a lure, and we have to accept the vanity of all reality. But what about the obvious opposite of wisdom, the sarcastic denunciation and unmasking of all pretense to sublimity which abounds in the film? Kung Fu Panda continuously oscillates between these two extremes, serene wisdom and its cynical commonsense undermining via the reference to common needs and fears? Such undermining is almost a running gag throughout the film \xe2\x80\x93 say, when Shifu runs to Oogway and tells him he has some bad news, Oogway replies with the standard wisdom \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no good or bad news, there are just news.\xe2\x80\x9d However, when Shifu informs him that Tai Lung has escaped, Oogway says: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is bad news\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Or, in the very last scene of the film, Shifu and Po are laying on their backs, meditating in silence; Po quickly gets agitated and says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about getting something to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d, and Shifu agrees\xe2\x80\xa6 But are these two levels (wisdom, everyday commonsense) really opposed? Are they not the two sides of one and the same attitude of wisdom? What unites them is the rejection of objet a, of the sublime object of passionate attachment \xe2\x80\x93 in the universe of Kung Fu Panda, there are only everyday common objects and needs, and the void beneath, all the rest is illusion. This, incidentally, is why the universe of the film is asexual: there is no sex or sexual attraction in the film, its economy is the pre-Oedipal oral-anal one (incidentally, the very name of the hero, Po, is a common term for \xe2\x80\x9cass\xe2\x80\x9d in German). Po is fat, clumsy, common, AND a Kung Fu hero, the new Master \xe2\x80\x93 the excluded third in this coincidence of the opposites is sexuality.\n\nIn what, then, does the ideology of the film reside? Let us return to the key formula: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no special ingredient. It\xe2\x80\x99s only you. To make something special you just have to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s special.\xe2\x80\x9d This formula renders the fetishist disavowal (split) at its purest \xe2\x80\x93 its message is: \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well there is no special ingredient, but I nonetheless believe in it (and act accordingly)\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Cynical denunciation (at the level of rational knowledge) is counteracted by a call to \xe2\x80\x9cirrational\xe2\x80\x9d belief \xe2\x80\x93 and this is the most elementary formula of how ideology functions today.\n'

###### b'This movie is amazing. Part of the reason why Tai Lung is a great villain is his relationship with Shifu. I could care less about his fight with Po when his fight with what was basically his father was so emotional and action packed'
###### b"While I would agree this has merit as a solid theory, I would disagree with the reason Oogway chose.  I would have thought it was because he already believed in himself, and mastered Kung Fu.  he never needed that boost that the scroll gave to Po.  Tai Lung's noodle soup doesn't need the secret ingredient, Po's did."

## Willy Wonka did not give Charlie the factory as a reward. It was a punishment just like he gave to all the other children, except this one was the worst of all.
#### b"Owning and running the chocolate factory was not a positive experience for Wonka. It took a very obvious toll on his mental health and made him basically unable to interact with other people. The trials he laid out were to see if the potential kids could take care of the factory. Augustus Gloop proved he would either eat or contaminate the product, Violet couldn't follow rules and let her own temptations disqualify her, Veruca was just mean and couldn't get along with the workers (squirrels), and Mike basically failed for the same reasons Violet did. All of these kids would probably either ruin the factory or sell it for cash. \n\nBut Charlie was the only one just gullible enough and innocent enough to take care of the factory and follow the rules forever, and Wonka saw that he was the only one suitable to push this hellish existence on. He'll be fine in the near future when his family is alive but when they're all eventually gone then he'll likely realize Wonka's factory was never a reward at all. "

###### b'Yeah but the brand is world famous apparently so he could just sell it to Kraft for billions and move to the Bahamas.'
###### b'Just like when we were kids, we thought being grown up and having our own jobs and responsibilities was going to be great because we would make the rules and own stuff. I knew even as a kid that the chocolate factory would be a lot of work and responsibility even with the Oompa-Loompas help. '
###### b'This would be great, but the sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  [\\("The Great Glass Elevator"\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Great_Glass_Elevator) covers Wonka\'s reasoning pretty thoroughly.'
###### b'So pretty much the world is a nihilist hell, and we are all doomed to be surprised by our unholy bondage upon reaching adulthood? Yep.'
###### b'I like when Saruman cleans wonkas teeth. '
###### b"Man, that's harsh, but yeah, I'm down with it."
###### b"Only if you're extremely pessimistic. It all depends on your own perspective of the world. Or Charlie's or Wonka's. Or mine. \n\nFrom my perspective, you could just as easily say Wonka wanted a person who had the best support system and was least likely to destroy the Wonka Legacy. Since Charlie had family that taught him how to be respectable, it's likely that the family will keep the company going. And since Charlie has an agreeable countenance and good work ethic he won inheritance to a massive fortune. \n\nI'm sure by virtue of growing up poor, Charlie will find his improved living conditions and lack of starvation a good situation. He will be able to afford to go to a better school while his parents can hire actual employees to run the factory. \n\nWonka was odd and a recluse, but there's no reason the factory or Charlie's family would have to be the same. \n\nI don't think I buy the punishment angle. It's all a matter of perspective. "
###### b'The literal definition of a "white elephant" gift, something given that requires so much responsibly and resources that it makes you worse off overall, bit everyone thinks it\'s a status symbol.'
###### b'I like it.\n\nNice one'
###### b'I interpreted Veruca\xe2\x80\x99s weakness to be self-entitlement and unwillingness to accept defeat and try other methods. To follow the thesis in this claim, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that out of a business point of view, Veruca would fail to adapt to situations. When running a business, you have to have a cool head and know when to cut your losses and move on to a new product idea. Being too stubborn in business just means you\xe2\x80\x99ll spearhead your business into failure, most of the times. \n\nAgain, to support your claim, what made Charlie ideal was not only his willingness to fall in line, but also his desperation. He was in a situation where his entire family was slowly dying to lack of capital funds. In the spirit of capitalism, even the worst work is palatable when the alternative is death. \n\nThe other kids had alternatives. Even if Veruca was the only upper-class child, the others were at least middle- or upper-middle-class. When having alternatives, a person might abandon a path that seems even the slightest troublesome. They could easily just drop the factory and instead decide to pursue arts or something entirely different. For Charlie, he has a grim reminder that the only thing waiting for him outside the factory is grim poverty. And his grandparents are continuous reminders for him of this. \n\nHaving this said, what Wonka fails to understand that what made his business successful was not only his love of candy and hard work, but his creative genius. Wonka is a classic case of an artist who decided to profit out of his creativity, but in that process emptied his creative reservoir.\n\nCharlie might be a hard-worker, but nothing in the book hints that Charlie has any creative genius to be able to maintain the candy-factory as the juggernaut of innovation that it was during Wonka\xe2\x80\x99s reign. Charlie will be able to uphold the business for a while, but without the creativity the business will starve itself and slowly dissipate. Charlie will most likely drown himself in work trying to keep the business alive, and most likely, his grandparents will pass without his presence in their final days; ironically making Charlie lose the very thing that he tried to protect by taking over the business.'
###### b'One major problem: Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s family was very poor and his mother was supporting 3 bed-ridden elderly people and Charlie on a low income job. You could say Wonka was setting Charlie up to fail, but even then there\xe2\x80\x99s really no where to go but up from that situation. '
###### b'Fuck that, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.'
###### b'OP needs to read some more (book 2)'
###### b'The chocolate factory was overall a positive experience for Wonka. He did not care for other people or their incompetence so he made his own world where he was in control and could have things his way. He lived in his own dream world and while it was a lot of work, it was something he loved. To think Wonka disliked his factory and wanted to pretty much punish Charlie with it is ridiculous. He knew he was giving Charlie a lot of work but that\xe2\x80\x99s why he wanted to see if he was as passionate about it as he was. Just because something is hard does not mean it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you happy and you don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it. From all indications, Wonka wasn\xe2\x80\x99t incapable of interacting with people, he simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to and enjoyed the fact he was able to live that way. '
###### b'Are you sure owning the factory made him eccentric? I\'m pretty sure it\'s the opposite; he designed it *because* he was already off his rocker.\n\nHe understands what it takes to run the factory and that it\'s a tough job, but it\'s not as if he is required to do so (unless there is some plot reason in the later publications). Every other kid failed the test of being industrious enough, capable of moderation anf decision-making, and humble\n\nNote how Charlie\'s humble upbringing makes him exactly the type of person (at least by Dahl\'s opinion) that can run the factory. Every other rich, spoiled brat has been conditioned to be coddled by daddy\'s money for the rest of their lives; they would run the factory into the ground but it\'s not as if they wouldn\'t have relieved Wonka of a miserable existence. The only reason for Wonka to care who gets it, if anyone, is that he\'s a legitimately good guy who doesn\'t want to see all the Oompa Loompas left out in the cold and wants to continue producing products; of course he has had a bad streak but as far as we can tell he only exercises it on the people we know he despises: rich people who spoil their kids, which become terrible people dud to their complete lack of parenting beyond getting everything they want.\n\nThere is no consistent reason he would want to punish Charlie and it\'s not even his MO to play a long game. If Charlie had a weakness (maybe he does have one mentioned and I just haven\'t read it in a while) Wonka would have exploited it at the end; why fake out Charlie on the last test when he already has a willing "victim?'

## [Star Wars] The reason all the corny Darth Vader lines are in fact befitting to his character
#### b'People have complained a lot about his "don\'t choke on your aspirations" line, but it was pointed out to them he has similar lines in the OT. Now, why does it fit his character to begin with? Why would a dark lord of the Sith make those horrible jokes?\n\nWell, before I ask you, I want you too look at some other Sith lords:  \nDarth Maul was (at least in the movie) an aggressive savage specialized in melee (lightsaber) combat - true to his name.  \nDarth Tyranus was a tyrant, ruling the CIS with an iron fist - true to his name.  \nDarth Sidious was indeed insidious, as his name suggest.  \n\nDo you know what "Vader" is? It\'s German for Father. And just as the name suggests, he makes horrible, horrible dad jokes all throughout his reign as lord of the Sith - while killing and torturing some people along the way, because you know, he is a Sith after all.\n\n\nEdit:  \nPssst /r/all... have you heard the tragedy of Plagueis "The Wise"?'

###### b"Vader truly is Obi-Wan's apprentice. Every damn time he makes one if those stupid jokes I just hear Obi-Wan snark"
###### b'Father is vater in German. It is spelled Vader in Dutch but pronounced differently.'
###### b'I\'m 100% ok with the "choke" pun.\n\nPeople complain about everything.'
###### b'Imagine if if instead of Vader saying "I am your father", he said "I fucked your mom", then laughed after.'
###### b'All these comparisons you make have names that sound like English words. That\'s why I\'ll never buy the "Vader means father in another language except it\'s pronounced differently" explanation when we have the much more pattern-consistent basis of "invader".'
###### b"Anakin skywalker has always been a creepy weirdo.  Getting his arms and legs burned off by his BFF isn't going to help the situation. "
###### b"I was okay with the line, but I felt like James Earl Jones' cadence was all off compared to performances in the OT. "
###### b'I personally found the "choke on your aspirations" line to be really chilling. I thought it kind of showcased how brutal and unforgiving Vader really is, seeing as he was still poking fun at the foolishness of a high-ranking Imperial officer, even as he was crushing his windpipe at the flick of his wrist.\n\nCan\'t believe people were complaining about that line lol'
###### b'It\'s also because Vader was pretty much always a sassy motherfucker. It\'s not enough to just choke a guy, you gotta lean in and say "I find your lack of faith disturbing." You know he was smirking behind the mask when he said that shit.'

###### b'"Perhaps you feel you\'re being treating unfairly?"'
###### b'Just want to say Vader is not german for father '
###### b'/r/dadjokes'
###### b"It seriously wasn't a bad pun. He's basically the dark lord and this guys superior. Its was definitely a cold thing to say to someone as you are choking them. It was both a quip and an order. This guy was very ambitious especially for being a guy in the upper ranks of the empires military. Tarkin is a cold SOB all on his own and stole this guys position in an office politicsey kind of way. Vader was basically telling this guy to get a hint that if he continues to do business the way he is doing it, someone will eventually off him in the process. He did choke on his ambitions and Tarkin used it to his advantage buy simply attacking the base with the death start which was arguably overkill. I think Tarkin used it as plausible deny-ability to destroy a political enemy. "
###### b'You probably shouldnt get your star wars facts from pitch perfect'

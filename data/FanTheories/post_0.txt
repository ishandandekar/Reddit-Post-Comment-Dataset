## [SPOILERS] Infinity War: "...you never once used your greatest weapon..."
#### b'The title quote comes from Thanos speaking to Dr. Strange about not using the time stone in their duel on Titan. I was always bothered by this line being dropped because it struck true with me;\n\n\nWhy didn\'t Dr. Strange use the time stone when they were battling against Thanos?!!\n\n\nAn answer became clear when I remembered certain key details from the Dr. Strange movie; even with the power to slow, pause, or reverse time we have seen foes with the ability to ignore the time stone\'s effects (Kaecilius and his acolytes). I think the power stone would have allowed Thanos to do the same; to bypass the -power- of the Time Stone. That\'s why it\'s the first stone Thanos retrieves. Not only does the power stone allow him to contain, control and amplify the power of the other stones, but also bypass the powers of any stones that could be used against him (in essence, over**power**ing other stones). Dr. Strange in viewing many alternate futures saw the futility of using the Time stone in their fight and chose to use it differently...\n\n-very- differently.\n\n\nWhen Dr. Strange pulls the time stone seemingly out of nowhere (like Loki did with the Tesseract) and floats it over to Thanos to save Tony we can see two unique elements to this transaction:\n\n\nThe first is that the stone is glowing brilliantly. Normally, when any of the stones glow like this it is because their power is being used. \n\n\nThe second is that Thanos is unable to grasp the stone physically but is instead grabbing on to what appears to be its aura. He even shoots Dr. Strange a glance over this peculiar phenomenon.\n\n\n This kicked my Fan Theory senses into overdrive and I have been trying to piece it together ever since.\n\n\nBefore I can launch into this, let\'s talk about the unique properties of all the other stones themselves; not their powers, the properties each stone itself possesses. \n\n\n* The power stone so full of...power... overloads and even destroys living beings coming into direct contact with it.\n\n\n* The space stone is able to house itself within, and propagate the existence of, a 4-Dimensional hypercube on a 3-Dimensional plane of existence (that\'s what a tesseract is).\n\n\n* The Reality stone doesn\'t have to remain a solid and can instead become a liquid (possibly a gas or plasma?)\n\n\n* The soulstone cannot be acquired without trading a soul.\n\n\n* The mind stone has its own consciousness or can develop consciousness (Vision).\n\n\nWe see that these unique properties tie back beautifully to the identity of each stone and are very well suited to them.\n\n\nSo what about the time stone?\n\n\nI would postulate that the time stone can be sent through time all by itself, going forward or backward. How would you play keep away with the time stone? Easy. Send it forward in time to where Thanos can\'t get it! The problem is (as comic fans already know) Thanos is immortal, so he can wait it out. Let\'s swing back to the exchange.\n\n\n*Dr. Strange conjuring forth the stone the same way as Loki did the tesseract is a gigantic misdirect!* Loki is able to conceal the tesseract with his godlike powers of illusion and while Dr. Strange could certainly be capable of mimicing this easy trick, I don\'t think that\'s what\'s happening. The stone is glowing brilliantly because it\'s actually travelling back in time from the future!\n\n\n(This becomes a lot easier to envision if you\'ve watched Bill and Ted\'s Excellent Adventure).\n\n\nWhen Dr. Strange hid the time stone it wasn\'t through some trick of light or illusion like Loki but by sending it forward in time to be used later. Only to be sent back when the Avengers had finished using it.\n\n\nThe time Stone can travel forward or backward in time, but not space. It will appear on Titan soon after the snap presenting itself to Tony.\n\n\nThis is also why Tony needs to survive. If the snap is inevitable then he is the only one smart enough to a) figure out what is going on when the time stone presents itself on Titan and b) study the stone in order to unlock the quantum realm (the same way the mind stone in the sceptre allowed him to create Ultron).\n\n\nThis is why the Gauntlet breaks from the snap! It\'s using a time stone from a reality where the Avengers have already won and sent it back in time. The paradox of using a stone from a mutually exclusive reality breaks the gauntlet and helps advance Dr. Strange\'s plan even further because it cripples Thanos\' ability to fight back when the Avengers start mounting their counter offensive.\n\n\nI think clips from the Infinity War trailer corroborates this. The clip of what looks like Tony taking off his glasses while an out of Focus Wong and Dr. Strange are in the background seemingly frozen in time also doesn\'t appear in Infinity War but might be pulled from Avengers 4 where Tony has acquired the Time stone and begun looking for ways to retrace his steps or travel into the past. The shot of the battle of Wakanda containing Hulk also didn\'t appear but may be from Avengers 4 when they have already gone back in time and must now face off against Thanos and his army again at Wakanda (because Hulk wasn\'t at the original battle).\n\nDr. Strange did use his greatest weapon! Just not -when- we think he did.\n\n**TL;DR: This is /r/FanTheories...your supposed to enjoy reading this stuff...it\'s way too much to fit in here**\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the kind words everyone. Feels great to have finally blown the nips off this subreddit.\nTwo questions coming up alot:\n\n1)How does Thanos pull the mindstone back and not blow the gauntlet? There\'s a difference between manipulating 1 object in the universe and the entire universe, additionally reversing the fate of the mind stone isn\'t what creates the paradox (though it leads to it) but killing half the universe does as this is the outcome they are trying to prevent (the stone that came from a future where the mindstone still exists).\n\n\n2) "the time stone was a star in the sky on titan" this could simply be a visual effect of how it travels back in time; stars in the sky emit light into the past afterall. "They are so far away and their light takes so long to reach us, all we ever see are their old photographs"\n'

###### b"AMAZING THEORY. Makes lot of sense. In first trailer it's a Captain America that's leading the fight in battle of Wakanda not black panther. In Avengers 4, Battle of Wakanda will be fought again. So when every one was joking that ant man and wasp are their but they are tiny that might come true!!!!!"
###### b'Betting on a time paradox like that is ballsy, but I really like this! '
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"This theory is fantastic. It connects so many little things.\n\n1. Everyone loves to rave about how Hulk wasn't actually in the fight on Wakanda, and how Marvel used the trailer to mislead us. We all laughed at how Banner had to wear the armor because Hulk wasn't showing up, so when they get a second chance, Hulk will realize he needs to fight or they die. They might also mount a more united defense in Wakanda the second time around (rather than letting the dogs bust through the wall so easily).\n\nBut more to the point, what a misdirect it WOULD be if they got us thinking it was a fake EDIT, and Hulk DOES join the fight on Wakanda in the re-match in A4.\n\n2. Thanos' comment about how Thor should have aimed for the head would almost PERFECTLY set him up to do exactly that during a time-rewind re-match.\n\n3. Tony's past work with the Infinity Stones really reinforces this, because it does show that he's the only character on Earth that is capable of making direct use of them (creating Ultron/Vision, etc.)\n\nWell done, /u/LoL-Guru!!"
###### b'> The first is that the stone is glowing brilliantly. Normally, when any of the stones glow like this it is because their power is being used.\n\nGood Eye'
###### b'I love this theory because it means that all the characters who died DID DIE.  It makes them legit deaths, because what we saw in Infinity War is now an alternate reality where Thanos wins with a snap.  Tony using the Time Stone from the only future where Thanos is defeated, allows Tony to put himself and the other Titan heroes into that victory timeline, at any point he chooses.  Maybe even as far back as Civil War, to prevent Cap and Tony from being on the outs in the first place, but most likely back to when Banner first shows up with Strange.  I\'m betting right at the conversation with Pepper, which will suddenly turn out different in the new version which will clue Tony in that it worked.\n\nPeter:  "Have you guys seen that really old movie Back To The Future?"\n\n\nEDIT:  Looking back from 2020, it was pretty close!  The deaths DID happen, and it took a second snap to bring them back, but they still lost 5 years of their lives.  They DID play \'back to the future\' and go even farther back than I predicted, to collect a new set of stones for the bring-back snap.   The conversation with pepper and most of Infinity War didn\'t end up coming back in Endgame, but we did meet Morgan and see the results of Tony\'s dream, because he made it happen.'
###### b'Theories like this are exactly why I hate this subreddit ...\n\nBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s so well thought out and covers so much and fits so well in the MCU and explains so much that it\xe2\x80\x99s just pure awesomeness.\n\nAnd It makes me sad that it\xe2\x80\x99s just a theory (right now) and may not be in the final film. \n\nKudos to you, this was awesome'
###### b'This is a great theory!\n\nIt also ties into Strange\xe2\x80\x99s line about only seeing one victory in all the possible outcomes of the upcoming battle. He knows what needs to happen for the Avengers to beat Thanos, so makes sure Thanos wins this time round. \n\nLove it!'
###### b"Holy crap how did you even spot that time freeze on the trailer, I just saw it now that you pointed it out. It's not that they're just standing still, they're literally not moving at all.\n\nNow this theory is pretty sound, but I'm also thinking that this could be the BARF tech that tony uses, but we'll see in avengers 4."
###### b"> This is why the Gauntlet breaks from the snap! \n\nMan this has been on my mind since I've seen the movie and I couldn't really think of any reason why it'd break, because it should be perfect with all the stones. This theory is fantastic!"
###### b'I really like this theory the paradox thing could be a little confusing for the general audience though. But if they explained it well enough it could definitely work. '
###### b'I like the theory but Captain Marvel is supposed to play a pretty big role in beating Thanos and reversing the snap. How do you think that would play into this?'
###### b"Seems like a great theory! The only thing I have to add is that if you look carefully at the scene where Strange gives Thanos the time stone, there is a star in the background that disappears, and never shows up again, implying that Dr. Strange disguised the time stone as a star, so it doesn't exactly come out of nowhere. It still could be coming from the future, but I think that is unlikely, and it's just glowing because it's true form is being revealed."
###### b"So the entire Thanos fight will happen again, and now changes can be made. Thor will aim for the head. The Hulk will fight in Wakanda. Peter Quill won't ruin the fucking plan."
###### b'This is amazing! You have a really great eye and imagination to think this through. I think this will be amazing to see played out in Avengers 4. It would explain why EVERYTHING is so hush-hush. '

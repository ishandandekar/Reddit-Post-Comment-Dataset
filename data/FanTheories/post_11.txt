## Why everyone in Guardians of the Galaxy sounds like they're in a PG-13 film
#### b"The reason that the language in both Guardians of the Galaxy movies is frequently juvenile and all profanity seems limited to the constraints of a PG-13 film is because we're usually hearing it as Starlord hears it through his universal translator (mentioned onscreen in the first movie's mugshot scene).\n\nStarlord was taken from Earth when he was eight. He probably stopped actually learning English shortly after, since it's unlikely that he had anyone else to actually speak it with. As such, his language (and all language he hears) is going to seem juvenile. Additionally, any profanity he knows probably came from movies and TV shows he saw before he was kidnapped."

###### b'Now the idea of an eight year old making a Jackson Pollack semen joke really disturbs me.'

###### b"And I'm sure they won't mention a word of it in Infinity War and all Guardians will just speak English to everyone else and it will be forgotten."
###### b"Fuck, I'm taking this as Canon now."
###### b"And yet, we have scenes like that but he's not there. Like rocket Groot and yondu on the reaver ship."
###### b'Possible addition to that, I noticed during my second viewing of Volume 2. Several times, Rocket mentions or demonstrates that he\'s a fan of Quill\'s music. However, during the "Summer Nights" scene, he\'s humming and scatting to the tune instead of singing along. What this could mean is that the translators only work on spoken word and to Rocket, the songs all sound like a foreign language.'
###### b"Everyone knows English is the chosen language for all alien races. Don't ask why, that's just the way it is."
###### b"If it just translates everyone's speech into English for Quill, shouldn't everyone else in GotG look like they came out of a poorly dubbed Kung-Fu movie? "
###### b'Is that also part of the joke with his name? That he thought it sounded like a cool name when he was a kid and never outgrew it?'
###### b'ITT:  People who don\'t understand this is a sub for theories.  "Duh, it\'s a movie" could answer any question about any movie.'
###### b'For me Guardians of the Galaxy is basically a love letter to your inner 13 year old. Dreaming you will go far away with a girlfriend that is also a stranger and your pets as companions fighting bad guys and doing pew pew noises'
###### b'Pic of scene that says Peter has a translator implant:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/81baFmp.jpg\n\n(In the bottom left portion of the screen)'
###### b"So you're suggesting that this universal translator is constrained by Starlord's past experiences. This doesn't seem right. A better theory would be that the translator is programmed or configured to provide a certain user experience and that Starlord isn't stupid or ignorant, but merely prefers a PG13 translation."
###### b"My alternative and pretty far out there theory is that it's because they are PG-13 rated movies"

## [Harry Potter] [Spoilers] Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger to make her fall in love with him.
#### b'**WARNING: SPOILERS ARE ALL OVER THIS THEORY LIKE DEMENTORS ON AZKABAN.**\n\nTLDR at the bottom...\n\nStay your pitchforks, brothers; lay down your torches, sisters; hold your downvotes Reddites until you consider the following: Ron Weasley isn\'t the cute, innocent boy he seems. In fact, he\'s possibly the biggest monster in the entire wizarding world.\n\n**Disclaimer**: The following theory is based solely on evidence presented in the films and does not take any content from the books into consideration. **Edit**: Just to clarify - this theory is based only on the films, not the books. Unfortunately, due to the number of differences/changes between the film and the book series that sometimes contradict each other, this theory is strictly an analysis of data from the movie series.\n\nI\'ve watched the Harry Potter films many times over the years, and each time I always felt a little confused as to why Hermione Granger ended up with Ron Weasley. Throughout the series, Ron is (in Harry\'s words) a right foul git to Hermione.\n\n* \\[[1](https://youtu.be/eVE375YQL0s?t=94)\\] **Sorcerer\'s Stone** / After the students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, Ron openly mocks Hermione to his classmates. Hermoine happens to overhear the cruel conversation and runs by, crying.\n* \\[[2](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Near the beginning of the movie, Ron is quarreling with Hermione about her pet cat, Crookshanks, and makes vicious comments.\n* \\[[3](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4?t=52)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Later in the film, Ron makes additional nasty comments about Hermione\'s pet.\n* \\[[4](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4?t=121)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / After Hagrid reveals that Ron\'s pet rat, Scabbers, is alive, Hermione attempts to elicit an apology out of Ron for his earlier comments. Instead of contriteness, Ron offers a disingenuous apology toward her cat to spite her request.\n* \\[[5](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=49)\\] **Goblet of** **Fire** / When the Quidditch World Cup is attacked by the Death Eaters, Arthur Weasley explicitly tells the children to stick together and run for the portkey. During this scene, Ron starts running with Hermione but fails to wait for her, leaving her behind completely while she stops to wait for Harry.\n* \\[[6](https://youtu.be/ZE9rtMB1TfQ?t=49)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / During class, Ron laments about finding a date for the Yule Ball then turns to Hermione as a last resort. When he does, Ron tries to shame Hermione into saying "yes" by stating "it\'s one thing for a bloke to show up alone but for a girl it\'s just sad."\n* \\[[7](https://youtu.be/RvSgbakp1RI?t=61)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / At the Yule Ball, Hermione sits with Harry and Ron while her dance partner gets drinks. Hermione is elated at the fun experience she\'s having which triggers Ron to make several sharp comments in an attempt to destroy her good mood.\n* \\[[8](https://youtu.be/rCGMWCljcqE?t=5)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Ron says he will go easy on Hermione, downplaying her abilities as a student-wizard. After Hermione easily bests Ron in one move, he downplays her accomplishment by stating he intended to lose.\n* \\[[9](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=23)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / During an after-game victory celebration, Ron is pulled into a kiss with Lavender Brown in front a cheering crowd (including Hermione). Ron makes no attempt to stop the kiss and embraces it, instead.\n* \\[[10](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=105)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / After Hermione runs away from the shock of seeing Ron kissing another girl, Ron gleefully skips through the halls with Lavender Brown and stumbles upon a weeping Hermione. Though he sees she is distraught, Ron doesn\'t apologize or show remorse or even abandon his frivolity with Lavender. He sees that his actions have hurt Hermione and he continues to run off with Lavender.\n\nYet, despite being treated so horribly, Hermione decides *"yeah, this sounds like a perfectly stable foundation for a relationship\xe2\x80\x9d* and marries him. I always wondered, where did the connection between them happen?\n\nBut upon watching the films again recently, I noticed something that I hadn\'t paid much attention to before. In the Deathly Hallows part 2, Ron Weasley performs the [**Imperius** **curse**](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse) on Bogrod, the goblin teller.\n\n* \\[[11](https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / During the scene where the trio break into Gringotts, Ron Weasley effortlessly uses the Imperius Curse on Bogrod, the goblin teller, without hesitation. Bogrod remains under the effects of the Imperius curse until his own demise at the fiery breath of the security dragon.\n\nWhen cast successfully, the Imperius Curse places the victim completely under the caster\xe2\x80\x99s control (unless the victim is strong enough to resist it) and it is one of three Unforgivable Curses that witches and wizards are forbidden to use.\n\nSo why does Ron Weasley know this curse?\n\nAt first, I thought he must have originally learned about it during Mad-Eye Moody\xe2\x80\x99s lesson about the Unforgivable Curses in the Goblet of Fire. But when I watched the scene again, I found out that **I was wrong**.\n\nRon actually already knew about the Imperius Curse prior to Mad-Eye Moody\xe2\x80\x99s lesson, and he learned it from his father, Arthur Weasley.\n\n* \\[[12](https://youtu.be/wsl5fS7KGZc)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / In the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Mad-Eye Moody provides a lesson about the three Unforgivable Curses, and he calls upon Ron to volunteer the name of one of the curses. Out of all three curses, Ron provides the Imperius Curse and says that he learned it from his father, thus showing he was already familiar with the curse.\n\nWhich leads us to our next question. When did Ron practice using the spell to be good enough to charm a goblin teller?\n\nCasting a spell in the wizarding world is not as simple as waving a wand and reading the incantation. If that were true, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be nearly as threatening. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the films, the ability to successfully perform any spell comes the same way any good skill does \xe2\x80\x93 through practice and proper form.\n\n* \\[[13](https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M)\\] **Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone** / The students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, demonstrating that casting magic is not as simple as wand-waving and word-mumbling. Without the proper technique, a spell\xe2\x80\x99s effects can have alternate (disastrous) results.\n* \\[[14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Professor Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to mend Harry\xe2\x80\x99s broken arm and fails (further proving that spells are not successful if they are cast by someone who has no idea what they are doing).\n* \\[[15](https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Harry trains with Professor Lupin to learn the Patronus Charm, but Harry is not quite able to cast the spell effectively right away. Even Chosen Ones have to practice to *git guud*.\n\nYou might be thinking, *\xe2\x80\x9cBut Harry also* [*cast the Imperius Curse*](https://youtu.be/F9KyOu_RchU?t=186) *on a goblin and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t running around practicing it on random folks. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just an easier spell to cast?\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nHarry has demonstrated (on multiple occasions) a talent for spell mastery due to his unique circumstances. I would argue that part of the reason Harry was able to cast the Imperius Curse so effectively in the Deathly Hallows part 2 without prior training is because he is Voldemort\xe2\x80\x99s Horcrux, and thus, inherits some of the Dark Lord\xe2\x80\x99s abilities (as evidenced through Harry\xe2\x80\x99s ability to speak [parseltongue](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue)). Otherwise, if the curse were really so easy to cast, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone just cast it for anything?\n\nWith that understanding, we have a reasonable guess as to why Harry can cast the curse so easily, but Ron doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any ties to the Dark Lord or the ability to master spells easily. Ron has, in fact, been historically slower at learning spells.\n\nSo, when (or **on whom**) did Ron practice the curse to become so effective at it?\n\nHe practiced it on Hermione Granger, which explains why she suddenly fell in love with him. Think about it. Ron was a jerk to Hermione across multiple films and then suddenly she\xe2\x80\x99s all over him, being giddy around him, staying at his house, and calling him brilliant.\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?! No. Ron would never do that. He might have picked on Hermione but that\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly evidence that he would do something so evil as to brainwash a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nOh ho-ho. Strap in, because there is evidence suggesting Ron is actually a lot darker-minded than we realized. But first, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about motive. Why would Ron even want to mind-control Hermione?\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s because he\xe2\x80\x99s jealous of her affection for Harry and is tired of being in Harry\xe2\x80\x99s shadow.\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cRiddikulus!\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not a Boggart; that won\xe2\x80\x99t work on me!\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cBut Hermione wasn\xe2\x80\x99t attracted to Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nActually, there are multiple signs that Hermione might have been initially sweet on Harry.\n\n* \\[[16](https://youtu.be/b6eIgrYraEc?t=175)\\] **Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone** / After Hermione repairs Harry\xe2\x80\x99s glasses, she recognizes him, even though they had never officially met. Harry\xe2\x80\x99s scar is not visible during this scene, so she would not have recognized him via his scar but of photographs of him. Simple moments of infatuation like this are often the foundation of young crushes that lead to romantic interests.\n* \\[[17](https://youtu.be/DfjM5SUkPPg)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Harry is reunited with Hermione in Diagon Alley while shopping for school supplies, where she ends up repairing his glasses once again and does so with a warm smile and bright eyes. This is much different to how she looks at Ron and may be a sign that some of that early infatuation that she had still lingered.\n* \\[[18](https://youtu.be/TJIG-KQPnvg)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / When Hermione is cured from the Basilisk\xe2\x80\x99s petrification curse, she crashes into Harry with a big, loving hug first and gives him huge smiles. When she turns to Ron, she does not offer the same warm greeting.\n* \\[19\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / When Professor Mcgonagall tells Harry he is unable to go on the class field trip to Hogsmeade village without a signed permission slip, Hermione looks back at Harry twice after their initial goodbye, and even offers an additional farewell wave. While this can be attributed to Hermione feeling bad about Harry\'s situation, the way she lingers can also be a sign that she likes him and wished him to be there with her.\n* \\[[20](https://youtu.be/R5xJbQL1eHo?t=154)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / During a quidditch match, Harry is attacked by a Dementor and falls unconscious. When he awakens, Hermione is at his bedside looking terrified and then relieved. She locks eyes with Harry the entire time and even plays with her hair, which can be seen as a sign of infatuation.\n* \\[[21](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=47)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / When the Quidditch World Cup game is attacked, Hermione fearfully calls out for Harry several times (while being dragged away by Ron).\n* \\[[22](https://youtu.be/JMrQ4uE4j84)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / Just before the first trial, Hermione enters the Champions\' tent and lovingly embraces Harry out of fear and worry.\n* \\[[23](https://youtu.be/K-tLdA55c3k?t=242)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / After the second trial, Hermione rushes to check on Harry and even gives him a kiss on the head. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall Hermione giving Ron any kisses in between his fits of nasty remarks.\n* \\[[24](https://youtu.be/GwJKdQ_dBY0?t=98)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / At the end of the film, Hermione encourages Ron and Harry to both write to her over the summer break. When Ron dismisses her offer with a snide remark (such husband material), she turns hopefully to Harry and is elated when he says that he will.\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a series of isolated incidents being misinterpreted, either. Even Albus Dumbledore, a powerful wizard with keen intuition and sharp intellect, thought Harry and Hermione might have been together. And even **he** was surprised to hear that Harry and Hermione were not together.\n\n* \\[25\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / When Albus summons Harry to his office the first time in order to ask Harry to gain Professor Slughorn\xe2\x80\x99s trust, he asks if Harry is seeing Hermione romantically.\n\nNow, imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re Ron: You\xe2\x80\x99re the youngest of 5 older brothers who is always in trouble (and being howled at), constantly being teased by your older siblings, and you\xe2\x80\x99re given embarrassing hand-me-down items over the years. To top it all off, you\xe2\x80\x99re a Weasley (a *Weasley*!), [who are looked down](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasley_family) on by other wizard families. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy feeling successful in that situation.\n\n* \\[[26](https://youtu.be/YDlz1JbLLZs?t=13)\\] **Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone** / Draco Malfoy makes degrading comments toward Ron Weasley.\n* \\[[27](https://youtu.be/ZUl4amon00E?t=64)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Mrs. Weasley yells at Ron.\n* \\[[28](https://youtu.be/EvWihzwI2uY?t=77)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Lucius Malfoy makes degrading comments toward Ron Weasley.\n* \\[[29](https://youtu.be/fBziSx7RtqY)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Ron receives a howler from his mother.\n* \\[[30](https://youtu.be/fNYo67ESmn0?t=16)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / Mr. Weasley jabs Ron with a passive-aggressive quip.\n* \\[[31](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ?t=30)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / Ron receives hand-me-down dress robes.\n* \\[[32](https://youtu.be/r94aUPdPgzk?t=44)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Hermione tells Ron he has *\xe2\x80\x9cthe emotional range of a teaspoon\xe2\x80\x9d*.\n* \\[[33](https://youtu.be/vxRqPmvGlUY?t=60)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / When asking Fred and George the price of an item in their joke shop, Weasley\xe2\x80\x99s Wizard Wheezes, the older brothers tell Ron the price is five galleons. When Ron pushes the issue, they raise the price to ten galleons. Immediately afterward, Ron turns away defeated and says to his friends \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone that sounds as if he\xe2\x80\x99s dealt with this type of thing for far too long.\n\nKnow what would make it all worse? If one day, you met a boy who was stupidly famous, obscenely rich, ludicrously successful no matter what he did, and was always the center of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Then that boy becomes your \xe2\x80\x9cbest friend\xe2\x80\x9d, so that any light of success you have is instantly darkened by his shadow of greatness. Imagine how frustrating that must feel after a few years.\n\n* \\[[34](https://youtu.be/12hxT4URRGU?t=121)\\] **Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone** / When Ron first meets Harry on the Hogwarts Express, he is so poor that is he unable to purchase any sweets from the trolley. But Harry flaunts his vast wealth by purchasing the entire trolley of sweets. This would be awesome for young Ron, at first, but eventually this becomes unbearable as he grows older.\n* \\[[35](https://youtu.be/f-XC-Lz2E5w?t=22)\\] **Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone** / Harry is invited to be on the Quidditch team after barley starting the school year. Some of Ron\xe2\x80\x99s older siblings had been on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and it was shown that Ron was hopeful to follow their footsteps. So it must have burned to see a kid come and take a spot on the team, thinking that it might be just because of his namesake.\n* \\[[36](https://youtu.be/gq0E5QN_mvo?t=66)\\] **Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone** / Harry is gifted the Nimbus 2000, the best flying broom in the entire school (at the time), and the gift was even from a professor. If you were in Ron\xe2\x80\x99s position, you would definitely notice the blatant favoritism shown to Harry Potter.\n\nAnd when you\xe2\x80\x99re always in the shadow of your friend\xe2\x80\x99s glory, you start becoming resentful and jealous, which prompts you to do things that make you feel successful (and in control). On a few occasions, Ron sours on Harry for seemingly no rational reason. Other times, Ron purposefully goes out of his way to keep Hermione away from Harry.\n\n* \\[[37](https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / After it is announced Harry Potter will participate in the incredibly dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, Ron becomes upset with Harry. At one point, Ron even quips, *\xe2\x80\x9cyeah that\xe2\x80\x99s me, Ron Weasley, Harry\xe2\x80\x99s Potter\xe2\x80\x99s stupid friend,\xe2\x80\x9d* which shows that he does actually resent being Harry\xe2\x80\x99s friend, deep down.\n* \\[[38](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=65)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / During the attack on the Quidditch World Cup, Ron is seen dragging Hermione away from Harry even though she is calling out for him. Instead of stopping to be a good guy and help his best friend, Ron makes it a priority to drag Hermione away from him.\n* \\[[39](https://youtu.be/bA5cIGdt9j4?t=18)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / On the Hogwarts Express, Hermione expresses concern about Harry while leaving the train but Ron immediately dismisses her concern while urging her to follow him off the train. Ron shows no concern for Harry and is quick to pull Hermione away the minute she asks about Harry.\n\nHarry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been the nicest friend to Ron, either.\n\n* \\[[40](https://youtu.be/ktfsgXyRbuc?t=38)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Ron attempts to console a brooding Harry and is harshly pushed away. This occurs just moments after Ron nobly defends Harry to a group of troubled Gryffindor members. This may very well have been the moment where Ron realizes that he is worthless.\n\nBut the most damning evidence of all, the one that shows us the true thoughts that plague Ron Weasley\xe2\x80\x99s mind, is in the Deathly Hallows when Slytherin\xe2\x80\x99s Locket, one of Voldemort\xe2\x80\x99s seven Horcruxes, reveals his darkest fears and anxieties. It reinforces all of the evidence we just reviewed \xe2\x80\x93 that Ron feels inferior to Harry, that he feels that his family doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love him, and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll never have a girl like Hermione because of Harry.\n\n* \\[[41](https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / When Harry opens Slytherin\xe2\x80\x99s Locket so that Ron can destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor, the locket speaks to Ron with dark whispers from his own heart. When the locket is first opened it says, *\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.\xe2\x80\x9d* Among the truths we learn about Ron through the locket are that:\n* o Ron\xe2\x80\x99s mother wanted a daughter.\n* o Ron\xe2\x80\x99s mother once admitted that she would have preferred Harry as a son.\n* o The locket\xe2\x80\x99s shadow of Hermione also said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared to the Chosen One?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKeep in mind, Slytherin\xe2\x80\x99s Locket could be lying in order to cripple Ron Weasley\xe2\x80\x99s spirit. But also keep this in mind\xe2\x80\xa6 If all the locket\xe2\x80\x99s words were complete lies, Ron would never have been paralyzed by them. The fact is, there was truth in the locket\xe2\x80\x99s words. The locket only whispered whatever dark thoughts were already in Ron\xe2\x80\x99s heart. This confirms that Ron was indeed jealous of Harry, indeed frustrated about not being able to \xe2\x80\x9cget the girl\xe2\x80\x9d, and insecure about his relationship with his family. All of this, added with the other evidence, means that it is absolutely plausible that Ron may have been driven to desperation at one point, whether he meant to or not.\n\nNow that we have a motive, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Ron\xe2\x80\x99s proclivity for dark behavior. Even if we might have a plausible motive, surely our sweet Won-Won would never even think about doing something so vile as to mind-control Hermione. Right?\n\nBut actually, he\xe2\x80\x99s shown us that maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s not the most noble Gryffindor.\n\n* \\[[42](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / While eating, Nigel Wolpert delivers a parcel to Ron then awkwardly lingers until Ron dismisses him. When Hermione gives Ron a questioning look, he admits that he promised Nigel Harry\xe2\x80\x99s autograph. Ron basically admitted to securing favors (such as servitude) in exchange for celebrity items, which shows a willingness to use his friendship with Harry to his personal benefit.\n* \\[[43](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner where the trio are deciding what to do with the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley is the first one to unflinchingly suggest murder showing that he clearly has a dark side. When Hermione meekly protests, Ron tries to justify his cruelty. Harry has to be the voice of reason by suggesting an alternate, less criminal solution.\n\nSo now we have a motive, evidence that Ron had knowledge of the curse to carry out the act, and we have seen evidence of Ron\xe2\x80\x99s darker personality.\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Imperius Curse only works on weak-minded wizards. Hermione is definitely not weak. Ron wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to charm someone as strong-willed as her.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n[Right you are, Harry!](https://youtu.be/sf1dH0Bibyk?t=9) The films have demonstrated Hermione to be a strong wizard, amazingly smart and incredibly skilled in a variety of subjects and skillsets. Normally, I would wager that Hermione would be able to resist the Imperius Curse. Except, Hermione is not always strong willed. In fact, when it comes to her friends, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her succumb to their requests before.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that, while Hermione would normally be able to resist an Imperius Curse from anyone else, she\xe2\x80\x99s not as strong willed when it comes to her friends. [Stress can also have negative impacts on a person\xe2\x80\x99s mental and emotional willpower](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/), and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Hermione go through a lot of emotional distress with her friends throughout the films, from worrying about Harry\xe2\x80\x99s safety to running off crying because of Ron\xe2\x80\x99s cruel comments. The stress Hermione deals with could have also attributed to her not being able to counter the Imperius Curse.\n\nI believe Ron took advantage of that fact to **groom** Hermione and lower her defenses so that he could successfully curse her.\n\n[Grooming](http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming) is a tactic seen in abusive relationships where a person\xe2\x80\x99s normal defenses (or strong wills) are overcome by slowly desensitizing them to abusive behaviors. It often works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse.\n\n* \\[[44](https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / While Harry is down by the lake with Neville, Hermione approaches Harry with a message from Ron, who is seen standing just a yard behind her. It is clear that Hermione is not thrilled about being used by Ron to deliver a message to a person he is within speaking distance of, but she does so anyway. After failing the first attempt, Hermione attempts to withdraw from the commitment and urges Ron to deliver the message. Ron pushes back and forces Hermione to follow through. Ron\'s choice to force Hermione to carry out such an asinine command can be seen as an attempt by him to assert his authority and will over her. This is considered [manipulation](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html), which is another form of abuse, where the manipulator (Ron) gets the victim to do something they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do through a variety of techniques.\n* \\[[45](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner, after Harry makes the decision to wipe the memories of the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley approaches Hermione, caresses her face, then tells her to perform the act of wiping the Death Eater\'s memory. This part of a grooming process, where the abuser (Ron) asks their victim (Hermione) to perform various acts that make them feel just as guilty as the abuser. Ron further imposes himself upon Hermione by making physical contact prior to giving a command. Note, that Ron doesn\'t ask Hermione to do it. If he truly cared about her, he would realize that wiping someone\'s memory might be a sensitive subject considering she just had to wipe her parents\' memories. Instead, Ron commands her to do it and Hermione follows through without any protest though it is visibly clear that she is completely uncomfortable with it. This is an example of grooming.\n* \\[[46](https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / While in search of a way to destroy Slytherin\xe2\x80\x99s Locket, the trio take turns carrying the Horcrux. While Ron carries the locket, he starts being overwhelmed by its darkness. Just being near the locket draws out the darkest fears and anxieties of a person. In this case, it happens to be Ron\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy of Hermione. Ron\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy eventually becomes so unbearable that he fights with Harry and then decides to leave. But before doing so, he stops to ask Hermione if she\xe2\x80\x99s staying or going. This is an example of [basic coercive](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html) techniques often used by abusers in relationships where the abuser (Ron) tries to maintain his control by forcing the victim to choose between them or something else. It\xe2\x80\x99s like horrific \xe2\x80\x9call or nothing\xe2\x80\x9d scenario where the victim, who clearly has feelings for the abuser, is muddled by the sudden pressure to abruptly make a decision that will have major lasting impacts. Typically, the victim in this situation would surrender to the side of the abuser, because the pressure of making that kind of decision in the moment is too great, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for anyone to just walk away. But in this case, we see Hermione actually resist. Interesting how she can do that when she\xe2\x80\x99s not under a mind-controlling curse. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Ron\xe2\x80\x99s only method of maintaining relationships is through coercion, manipulation, and mind-control, at this point.\n\nRon just isn\xe2\x80\x99t an insensitive brat, he\xe2\x80\x99s an abusive friend and a manipulator, as well.\n\nThe fact that Hermione is a victim of abuse and a victim of the Imperius Curse becomes even more clear during the Deathly Hallows, when Ron decides to leave out of jealousy. After Ron leaves, Harry and Hermione instantly start connecting, almost as if Hermione changes without Ron\xe2\x80\x99s influence.\n\n* \\[[47](https://youtu.be/GM5WI4MTXzc)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / After Ron has left, some time passes, and Harry and Hermione are sitting alone together in their camping tent when they make a sudden connection. As if Hermione is starting to wake up from a nightmare.\n\nSo, now we have to determine: When did it all happen? At what point did Ron lose himself and do the unthinkable to Hermione?\n\nConsidering all the evidence, I believe, sometime during the Order of the Phoenix, Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger. This is the time we start seeing Hermione hang around Ron a little more closely but she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite started falling over him. That happens during the events of the Half-Blood Prince where Hermione is not only sleeping over at Ron\xe2\x80\x99s house a few days before the start of the school year but she\xe2\x80\x99s also looking at him more and becoming incredibly upset when he runs off with other girls.\n\nMore specifically, I believe it may have first occurred during the winter break of the school year during Order of the Phoenix.\n\n* \\[[48](https://youtu.be/-mJqm_ijE6s?t=25)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Inside the House of Black, the Weasleys celebrate the Christmas holiday with the return of Arthur Weasley (who had been previously attacked) and exchange presents. When Ron opens his present, Hermione smiles warmly at Ron. This is odd because in the previous scene, Hermione is digging at Ron with her usual sharp wit. There is seemingly no reason for her to smile at Ron like that during something as simple as unwrapping a present unless something had happened between them. Maybe they cozied up during the winter break? Or maybe, Ron decided he\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of being the sidekick of the group and used the Imperius Curse on Hermione for the first time. This scene occurs after Harry snaps at Ron, who was only trying to help \\[39\\]. Notice, too, in this scene that Hermione does not greet Harry when he arrives. She has typically given Harry big, bright welcomes in the past but here, she only gives him a frowning glance. This could suggest that Ron used the Imperius Curse to also tone-down Hermione\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm for Harry.\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cBut Hermione doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like she\xe2\x80\x99s under the influence of the Imperius Curse.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nThe films have been inconsistent with how the Imperius Curse is represented. For example, in the Goblet of Fire, [victims of the curse are shown to have milky eyes](https://youtu.be/FyqA7eWrFt8?t=123). But during Mad-Eye Moody\xe2\x80\x99s lesson on the Unforgiveable Curses \\[12\\], the Professor says that many wizards and witches claimed they only followed Lord Voldemort because they were under the influence of the Imperius Curse, and implied it was a challenge to determine which ones were lying about being cursed. This would suggest that the curse does not always manifest itself in a visible way. Additionally, in the Deathly Hallows, when Ron and Harry use the Imperius Curse on the goblins \\[11\\], the victim does not adopt any physical characteristics that would imply they are bewitched.\n\nBased on this, we can safely assume that people under the influence of the Imperius Curse are not always going to show obvious signs.\n\nBut while I believe Ron bewitched Hermione, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Hermione was under the influence the entire time. I believe Ron used the curse a few times in short bursts. Just long enough to start grooming Hermione so that she notices him instead of Harry. I also believe that the kiss Ron and Hermione share during the Deathly Hallows part 2 is not because of the Imperius Curse, but is a direct consequence of Hermione being cursed multiple times.\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re still not convinced, if there\xe2\x80\x99s even a shred of doubt still lingering after considering all of the evidence, then let me leave you with one last thing.\n\nAt the end of the Deathly Hallows pt. 2, when our beloved trio of friends (now adults with children of their own) watch their children ride towards Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express, look at Ron\xe2\x80\x99s expression.\n\n* \\[[49](https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=117)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / In the final scene of the entire film series, Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk their children to platform 9\xc2\xbe to board the Hogwarts Express.

Though the films are based on the books, the films are different; changes were made to the original story. The films aren\'t continuing the story of Harry Potter, they are retelling it. Unfortunately, within the film universe\'s retelling, there is plenty of evidence there to suggest Ron used the Imperius Curse on Hermione so that she would fall for him.\n\n    Edit - Additional Evidence (Provided by YOU!)\n\n[u/JohnWickIsMyPatronus](https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnWickIsMyPatronus) writes...\n\n>I happen to be watching Goblet of Fire right now, and I noticed something that also points to Ron being abusive.  \n>  \n>At the ball after Harry introduces Ron to the Patels as their dates, and Mcgonagall says that Harry has to do a customary dance at the beginning of the ball, Ron and one of the Patels start off toward the hall. While walking toward the hall, Patel looks back with a bit of disappointment toward Harry and the other Patel. Ron looks along with her, clearly upset with his robes and jealous of Harry\'s robes. Right after that, he grabs Patel by the arm and forces her to walk toward the hall while muttering "let\'s go."  \n>  \n>It\'s the grabbing of the arm and forcing her somewhere that makes it seem like he\'s comfort doing so, and maybe has done it before. [Looking closer at it,  he clearly gives her a push toward the dance.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&t=1m55s)\n\n\\[[E1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&t=1m55s)\\] This adds supporting evidence to the idea that Ron was becoming increasingly resentful of Harry and also provides additional evidence of Ron\'s controlling (almost possessive) behavior toward women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[u/bubblegumdog](https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegumdog) writes...\n\n>I always thought the most damning evidence was the final scene in the last film (not including the epilogue) where Hermione comes up to Harry after he breaks the Elder Wand and grabs his hand and just admires him without looking away. Then Ron comes up and she takes his hand as well and then her face completely changes. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she have had the reaction she had with Harry with Ron instead?  \n>  \n>One could argue she was proud of Harry at that moment for breaking the wand but it still begs the question: why does Hermione\xe2\x80\x99s face fall when she grabs Ron\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\n\n\\[[E2](https://youtu.be/9LcT9kisys4?t=120)\\] This adds supporting evidence that Hermione is seemingly struggling with her feelings after having been previously cursed. Look closely at Hermione\'s expression as she takes Ron\'s hand. She looks down, suddenly lost in though, then blankly looks forward. It\'s almost as if she\'s waking up and realizing that something isn\'t right. I don\'t believe she is cursed in this scene but it looks like she\'s starting to become aware that her feelings for Ron may not be natural.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;'

###### b'Major problem with this theory is the trace. The ministry would know immediately if a young wizard used an unforgivable curse.'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'~~If Ron was cursing Hermoine as early as Azkaban, she\'d have gone with him to the Ball, instead of Krum. That\'s probably the biggest nail in the coffin right there. She\'d have "decided" as soon as Ron learned about it.~~ Edit- got the timeline wrong. \n\nAnd there\'s no way Ron learned the curse from his father. Learned *ABOUT* it certainly, but I doubt that Arthur would ever straight teach it to his kids, considering he\'s part of the Ministry (and it\'s 110% illegal), and he\'s a member of the Order, which fought against Voldy and his methods on a moral level, and would be fundamentally opposed to it. '
###### b'This is excellently annotated and I appreciate it.\n\nHowever a lot of Hermione\xe2\x80\x99s more fun interactions with Harry are either lifted from Ron or just written for the film altogether. \n\nIn the books it\xe2\x80\x99s quite obvious that Hermione is sweet on Ron. Super sweet on him, tbh. Which is why Ron\xe2\x80\x99s comments bother her so much...they\xe2\x80\x99re friends but he\xe2\x80\x99s the friend she wants to be with. \n\nThe movies create a lot of sexual tension between the two and Emma tested best acting wise with the audience so was given a lot more of the material. But they can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of Dan being Harry because duh, it\xe2\x80\x99s about him, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why Ron\xe2\x80\x99s character is cut down and appears to be kind of a dick. Movie Ron is a dick! \n\nBut book Ron is warm and fun who has an insane jealous streak. He is the forgotten child; the last boy on the quest for a girl. There\xe2\x80\x99s 5 older siblings before him in a very poor family. So handmedowns galore and it\xe2\x80\x99s not like they\xe2\x80\x99re on the first pass down, it\xe2\x80\x99s at least the third. And while he could rationalize this is he had a younger sibling to hand his stuff down to, his sister now gets new things so there\xe2\x80\x99s even less of a reason/money to get him his own things. \n\nRon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take rejection well. He often clowned on hermione so hard because he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid to be vulnerable and open himself up to hurt. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Lavender and him happen...she\xe2\x80\x99s so so so into him he feels no concern she\xe2\x80\x99s going to leave. But then she\xe2\x80\x99s too much and he truly wants to be with Hermione (my books are in storage or I\xe2\x80\x99d find the passage) where he looks to her to help him break up with Lavender. \n\nShoot he even talks about her in his sleep (it\xe2\x80\x99s implied in the books there was more than just him saying her name). \n\nRon has never gotten anything he has wanted and his insecurities tell him that Hermione WOULD AND SHOULD want to be with Harry...that\xe2\x80\x99s what the locket does. It felt the pain and deep fears in your heart...That\xe2\x80\x99s why it impacts Harry the way it does (what if this is pointless; what if Voldemort will just win; we aren\xe2\x80\x99t accomplishing jack shit and wasting time) and for Ron he sees Harry and Hermione interacting and the locket stirs up even more of these emotions. \n\nI started writing a theory awhile ago about what each of the horcruxes represented (diadem is mentality, locket is deep set fears, diary is pouring yourself into it etc) and this is how each of them are supposed to destroy any individual who is not Voldemort that has possession of them. \n\nIn short I like your ideas and your dedication but there\xe2\x80\x99s so so so much more to in the books that you\xe2\x80\x99re missing out on right now. '
###### b'Fantastic post, well formatted. I disagree. We are shown that while under the influence of the spell the victim is completely under the control of the caster, and I know of no lingering effects from the imperious curse, and if there was then the Death Eaters who got off based on their claims of being Imperioused would remain suspect. \n\nSo the idea that Ron would sometimes cast the spell and then undo it, but would still have a lingering effect just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for me. From the Watsonian perspective rather, Hermione was a conflicted young woman who may well have been manipulated by Ron (that evidence remains) but was ultimately rejected by Harry when he chose Ginny over her. At worst though it was a childish young man who emotionally manipulated his friend and later girlfriend. But Ron is not without his redeeming qualities.'

###### b'Okay, I actually read all (most) of this wall of text you created. You put a lot of work into this. My biggest question would be the part where you said he cursed her multiple times. I would understand why she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone why he was doing if she was constantly cursed. If he stopped the curse why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just tell someone what he was doing when it wore off?

I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly believe the theory not because of her not speaking up but because in the books it genuinely seems like she chooses Ron regardless of all the problems they\xe2\x80\x99ve had. Also, Harry always had a thing for Ginny so she might\xe2\x80\x99ve just moved on and settled for Ron.'
###### b'People who had the Imperious Curse cast upon them [remember what happened after it is lifted.](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Imperius_Curse)'
###### b'I\'ve heard an alternative theory that Ron and Ginny used love potions on Hermione and Harry.\n\nGeorge and ~~Fred~~ sold love potions at the joke shop, so Ron and Ginny had easy access to them. Ron had a firsthand experience in book 6 on the power of love potions.\n\nYou outlined how fundamentally incompatible Ron and Hermione seem. Ginny didn\'t quarrel with Harry, but rather she had a fangirl obsession with him, and they never really had anything in common besides "likes quidditch".\n\nIt\'s not so far a stretch that either or both of the Weasleys would use their easy access to potions to get the person they wanted.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course, the major hole in the love potion theory is that the love potion we actually saw on screen acted *very* different than how Harry and Hermione act towards Ginny and Ron.\n\nOn the other hand, Dumbledore speculated that Merope Gaunt dosed Tom Riddle Sr. with potion for an extended period of time. If he\'d been acting rabid as Ron did in book 6 then surely it would have caused problems. This lends credence to the idea that not all cases of love potion use result in that behavior.\n\nYou could argue that different potions at different strengths brewed by different potion masters could lead to different effects, but that\'s going into speculation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: My grammar sucks. Thanks u/Dryu_nya!'
###### b'I have a much more wholesome alternative theory which is that Ron and Hermione we\xe2\x80\x99re secretly dating at early as movie 3. When Harry sneaks up on them with his invisibility cloak they are completely alone, admiring the shrieking shack. You\xe2\x80\x99d think on a trip to hogsmeade Ron would be hanging out with the other guys from the common room, but instead he\xe2\x80\x99s alone with Hermione. I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced this is one of their secret \xe2\x80\x9cdates\xe2\x80\x9d that they went on periodically throughout the years. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Hermione expected Ron to obviously ask her to the Yule ball a year later, because they have a past. And when Ron wants to go with her after seeing how beautiful she looked, it hurts her even more because Ron seemed completely done with her before. This makes it so that when they finally get together, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really the first time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time they agree to actually do it for real and be a couple. '
###### b'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t treating the person who you like like crap kind of like how kids show affection to each other? The fact that they are so at odds with eachother in the beginning makes sense. '

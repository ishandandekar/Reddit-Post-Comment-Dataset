## Entitled old woman grabs autistic kid.
#### b'This story is kinda different, in the way that I (employee) witnessed a autistic young man, ( maybe 14years old) get caught up in some crazy lady Idwhl situation.\n\n\nLet me set the scene for ya,\n\n\nI, working as door greeter watching out for lost Customers and folks with returns, working in lawn and garden section, I see this autistic young man ,( I guess he is autistic, as he seems predominantly focused on his action and kinda has the actions of an autistic individual.)\n\n\nThis young man is sorting and moving potted flowers around putting them in a very specific order, matching colors, size of pots, and height of the flowers themselves, ( doing an amazing job at it too I may add.)\n\n\nHe is bothering noone and most folks are just noticing him doing a bang up job,\nBut this one old crone of a woman sees him "working" she stands behind this young man arms folded and tapping her foot, (at first I was thinking maybe it was her son or someone she was shopping with, but the next thing she did proved to me I was mistaken.)\n\n\nShe clears her throat in that dreaded fashion we all know, " ahem...excuuuuuuuse me You need to help me."\n\n\nThe young man pays her no mind, continuing with his task, she doesn\'t like this, she clears her voice and replies louder,. YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME, YOU ARE GOING TO HELP ME NOW!!!.\n\n\nBefore I can walk to her and ask her what she needs she reaches out and grabs this young man by the right arm just above his elbow, I guess the sudden action of this and the young man\'s condition caused him to spin around and jerk his arm away from this lady, and the sudden movement startled the old woman causing her to step backwards and lose her balance causing her to sit down on her butt.\n\n\n(It was like in slow motion watching her go from standing to sitting on the ground)\n\n\nBy the time I reached the young man to see if he was ok, his mother had shown up and was asking what had happened, before I could say anything the woman who had caused this was up and berating this young man. Saying he attacked her and she will have him fired and arrested, meanwhile this young man was almost crying and his mother was shocked.\n\n\nI told the mom to take her son and calm him down, that he has done nothing wrong and just make sure he is ok.\n\n\nCrazy old women didn\'t like that I took his side, she began to lie and tell me she was the victim and she didn\'t do anything, that the employee (young man) attacked her.\n\n\nI told her not so kindly \n1. she was a liar and I had witnessed the whole incident\n2. The young man you forcibly grabbed does not work here and you assaulted him.\n\n\nBy now a crowd has gathered, and the crazy woman has noticed that noone is giving her looks that they believe her side of the story.\n\n\nShe just puts her head down and walks quickly out the store.\n\n\nWhen I turn to check on the young man and his mother She was smiling at me and was thanking me for my help, she shops here regularly and the young man likes to arrange the flowers, it\'s calming to him, I express my regrets about the whole incident, the young man walks over to me and Pats my shoulder once and goes back to the flowers, the mom informed me that was the equivalent of a high five from him.\n\n\nThat was it, then they were gone.\nIf this story doesn\'t qualify for this sub, mods feel free to delete.\n\n\nJust wanted to share.'

###### b'When all you want to do is see the world in a state of beautiful order but some random crone starts screaming at you'
###### b"Good for you for sticking up for him. I'm seriously\xe2\x80\x8b glad you shut her lying ass down."
###### b"man,  i don't understand the sense of entitlement in some people.\n\nDON'T grab people you don't know. You don't know how they might feel or react to physical contact. how is that a hard concept to understand? "
###### b"I don't care who you are, don't ever grab someone that you don't know. That's a quick way to receive an uppercut "
###### b'My gosh my blood was boiling reading about that old crone!\n\nGood on you taking care of it the way you did. I hope you get to see the nice young man and his mother again.\n\nHave you looked into having the unpleasant woman banned?'
###### b"Don't fucking touch people without their permission. I don't like to be touched by people either. Don't be a dick."
###### b"Why would she think that grabbing any employee would get things done for her, whether they're autistic or not?"
###### b"It sucks that there are people like that in the world. But I'm glad that there are people like you in it, too. \n\nEDIT: I meant it sucks that there are people like that horrible old bitch in the world. Not the person with autism.\n\nEDIT 2: What the fuck, 2k upvotes? Thank you :)"
###### b'An observation from reading this sub... It seems like some customers in US stores say things like this lady did: "You need to help me now." Is this sort of attitude common in the US? Coming from the UK, the vast majority of people in shops basically apologise for existing...'
###### b"How horrible is it to live as that old woman? My god. She comes to the store to buy who knows what (maybe nothing at all, just going to browse and be out of the house, probably retired and has alienated all of her kids, if she has any). She's so dissociated from normal social mores that she not only verbally harangues someone who's not even in a uniform, she grabs them on the arm, she's so committed to her perception not just that this young man's an employee of the store but that it's okay to grab strangers too. He abruptly creates distance, as any sane person would; you find yourself shocked and startled and can't keep your balance as the narrative playing in your head starts crumbling all around you. You try to explain, to get some allies, to save face, but you're obviously in the wrong and there's no denying it. You sheepishly shuffle out of the store to your car, or more likely to the bus stop, and you play this incredibly embarrassing and difficult event over and over in your head. Maybe you're stuck shelving it away in your mind as another example of how you're the first martyr of the world and somehow no matter what happens or where you go, you wind up a victim. Or maybe you beat yourself up for ruining another trip out into the world for being so stupid. Maybe you have a window of clarity and wonder for a brief moment how the kind little girl that you were born to be grew up through a long, long, long life and wound up as a shrieking and inscrutable creature, unrecognizable to yourself and to civilized people, incapable of making successful human contact. \n\nMaybe you just go buy a handle of smirnoff and drown it all in the parking lot.\n\n"
###### b"As a father of a 14 year old autistic child I'm amazed at the resolve of his mother.\n\nMy wife would have given that woman the worst tongue lashing she'd ever experienced. You do not fuck with her child.\n\nHell, she doesn't even like it when adults *look* at him the wrong way. "
###### b'If the young man is a semi-regular and does some actual work to make the store prettier, you should consider making him a vest that says "I don\'t work here, I just like to sort things" on the back. His mom will appreciate it, and he will feel rewarded and useful. (Or he will have a random autistic preference you didn\'t adhere to, and you will still have pleased the mom)'
###### b"Good for you! In so glad you stuck up for him. I have autism as well, and even at my level of functioning, people touching me out of the blue often brings a similar reaction. You're such a kind person for sticking up for that kid! Was he non-verbal do you know? "
###### b'Aww, the shoulder pat. For most of my life that was equivalent to a hug, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hug people.'
###### b"My brother is autistic, and I've done a lot of personal assistant work for other young men with autism. I've had to deal with the fallout of interactions like this way too many times. Good job doing the decent thing, no doubt you helped a lot. I'm just sad to think about how much effort it's probably going to be to get the poor lad out the house again. Let alone doing that sorting activity, which his mother probably relied on so she could quickly grab other things without trailing him round. \n\nPeople have no idea of the work and complexities involved in having a single smooth-running day. And how much work can randomly be destroyed by one idiot. Grr."

## I. DID. NOT. ACCEPT. THE. JOB. Now please let me enjoy my holiday
#### b"This happened about 4 years ago when i was looking for work.\n\nMy Second Interview was for a 'Marketing' position at a new firm. The interview went well and i was offered a trial shift the following Monday. On turning up it became clear that this wasn't a marketing job but a door to door sales job for what was basically a huge MLM. The 'service' was to sign people up for charities on monthly donations. To make matters worse we were told to lie to consumers about our pay status (we would make a commission effective to their first 2 months donation, my 'boss' would then get another month and the company would get the rest equivalent to 6 months donations). We weren't supposed to tell people that and had to tell them we were salaried (we weren't - i only found out during the trail it was commission only)\n\nSo far not so good. When they 'offer' me the 'job' I let them know I have another interview lined up the following day and tell them I'll let them know by the end of the week.\n\nThe interview goes well, it's a real (albeit temporary role) and I'm offered the job and inform the MLM of my decision. This is somehow a 30-minute call where he's still trying to convince me to work for him with me saying i'm not interested at all.\n\nFast forward to the next Monday and i'm rudely awoken at 9:15 with a phone call. I answer to this: (i hadn't saved his number)\n\nMe: Hello Me Speaking\n\nMLM: Where the hell are you?!?!?\n\nMe; Sorry? wh-\n\nMLM: You were meant to be here at 8:30 - this isn't a good start to your first day is it? Why are you so late?\n\nMe: Sorry but who is this?\n\nMLM: It's (not the interviewer) from \\*\\*\\*\\*. you know the company who YOU work for, it's too late now your team has left, you better be on time tomorrow\n\nMe: Sorry there must've been a misunderstanding, i got offered a job at xxx and accepted that role, sorry for this.\n\nMLM: well you should have told us this, it's not professional to just not turn up and we would've hired someone else, now your team is short staffed...\n\nme: I told \\*\\*\\*\\*, maybe check with him, anyway i need to go, bye\n\nHoping this is resolved i get up and go about my day. Tuesday morning i am again awoken to the same guy demanding reasons for me not turning up to work (Apparently not working for them isn't a valid excuse)\n\nThis amazing continued until the following Monday where i was 'let go' for 'unauthorized' absences.(when asked if this means he'll stop phoning me he told me to grow up and be professional about it)\n\nThink i dodged a bullet there...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow this really took of, thanks for the gold XD also updated spelling to Would've, Should've"

###### b'I had an interview with one of these "Marketing" companies too. I don\'t understand why these companies are still allowed to operate with their deceitful practices. Fortunately, as I was still working, I was able to tell them at the interview that I wouldn\'t be able to the second stage "interview" the following day, but offered to reschedule and they never got back to me. The second stage "interview" is basically a day of work unpaid. I didn\'t get the harassment you got thankfully.\n\nEdit: I\'m not actually asking how these companies are allowed to operate, it was a rhetorical wonder out loud kind of question. There\'s no need to bring politics into the discussion. '
###### b'I had almost the same thing. Was told it was an in house marketing position.\n\nShowed up and my "interview" was me in a room with about 20 other confused people.\n\nThe company had been described as a whole sale and high end kitchen utilities company, what they meant was door to door knife saleman. I mean who the fuck buys a knife from a guy at the door.\n\nAfter the "interview" I asked the guy if there had been a miscommunication as I was told this was a 9-5 office job. He told me everyone had to start as part of the street team and after a year they would promote people.\n\nNeedless to say I left without signing anything. They called me for over a year telling me they couldn\'t get me started until I filled out my paperwork, and that I was already assigned product so I was obligated to sell it.\n\nI ignored them and eventually they went away. I wonder if my knives are still just sitting there not earning me my potential 25k a month.'
###### b'I always joke with my friends that have been studying marketing in college that they need to be careful when applying to marketing jobs afterwards because a lot of them in my area end up being MLM scams like this. Quite a few have told me that they have found a majority to be MLMs. There was one time where I was offered to interview as a receptionist at a marketing company, not my major but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind since it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a marketing position. I get there and we sit to interview and they later offered the position. There were plenty of others in the office and it looked like a real office, so my desperate for a job ass took it. I get there for my first day and they go straight in to training me to sell things in bulk sale stores, like Costco or Sams. Turned out the job paid minimum wage with some commission, so I figured screw it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue looking for another job and just stick around until I find something. After talking to several other women who had been hired I found out they had all been told they were hired as a receptionist as well, and I guess the guys were told it was desk work and pre planned and approved sales calls.\nSo yeah, MLMs are total BS.'
###### b'I had a similar situation with one of those MLMs that advertises to be a "marketing" firm, but is really a commissioned sales position.  They did a trial day in which you stood in a store lobby selling junk for charity, and even the guy with me who I was shadowing told me that nothing goes to the charity in terms of cash, "its all about awareness"\n\nThe whole setup was suspect, and by my calculations the average salesperson working their would have been making just below minimum wage, all while having to drive their own vehicles to the sales site that were often 2-3 hours away.  Fortunately, after I not-so-politely told them where they could stick that job, they didn\'t continue calling.'
###### b"I was hired on at a company like that. During the interview I kept asking what my responsibilities were and what I would be doing and they kept avoiding the fact it was a door to door position. The way they made it sound I thought it was an office position. I did not bring good walking shoes or weather appropriate clothing for my first day. After a day that included the group I was with talking about how they stole lab equipment from their school to make drugs, being told I should lie and say I'm a student trying to save money for text books, doors slammed in my face, and an old man yelling at me because UNICEF is the antichrist or something I quit. "
###### b'Whaaaaaat I can see it happening once but dead ass three times? Same guy? Wtf. How many different ways do you need to tell someone you dont work for them lmao '
###### b'I too had an interview and a trial for one of these companies. As soon as I clicked to what it was I tried to ruin my chances of getting a job for them. This included excessive swearing, and bragging about how many times I call in sick when I\xe2\x80\x99m not sick to my other job '
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b" Cross- post this to /r/antimlm - they'd love it!"
###### b'Should have called him at all hours of the night and asked him where he was. '
###### b"I went to one of these, again by deception, I was interviewing for minor IT work I thought.   At the door they wanted me to 'check my devices' There was NO way I was handing over my phone to go to an interview.  He got really mad about it and I left, couple people followed me.  I got calls for about a week as if I was hired.   "
###### b'I had something similar happen to me at a limousine company in the Bay Area.  They said they\'d train people with a good driving record, help them get their commercial license, etc.  Showed up for the "interview" with roughly 100 other people.  \n\nTurns out you had to PAY for your training, and then they\'d select limited applicants from the ones that got their license.  During the first break, I walked out.\n\nThey called me at least 4 times over the following week to find out why I hadn\'t signed up.'
###### b'I had an interview for one of these \'marketing\' jobs too, the whole thing is basically a pyramid scheme and they made no effort to explain it was commission only up until I did some research of my own online. I ended up telling them it wasnt for me as they lied to me during the \'interview\' process and I didnt hear anything back. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would strongly recommend anybody to steer clear of any "Marketing assistant" jobs or anything to do with "face to face events" or anything to that effect. Those poor newly graduated souls... don\'t know whats about to hit them! '
###### b'Were you able to collect unemployment?\n'
###### b"Did you fill out any paperwork at all that has any sort of personaly identifiable information it?  Drivers license number, SS#, address, birhtday.... that sort of shit?\n\nThese clowns cannot be trusted with that info.  If they have it, there is zero you can do about them having it.  Don't bother bothering them about it.  \n\nBut, keep eagle eyes on things like credit reports and such.  For the next couple years running a complete credit report every 6 months might be smart."

## CAVEMAN SPEAK
#### b'So in the \'90s I rented a large workshop with two friends. I was a woodworker and the other two were metal workers so obviously none of us resembled the previous business, which had installed skylights, in any way.\n\nCue the customer of the previous business. C. I have condensed this as the verbatim conversation went on for a \\*very\\* long time.\n\nArrives at my door. A real "Karen".\n\nC: "I need repairs done to the skylights you installed"\n\nMe: "Sorry, that business has moved and I don\'t know where they are now"\n\nC: " No, I need you to send someone over NOW. The Skylights are leaking"\n\nMe: " As I said, that business has gone. We are a different company."\n\nC: "No, RIGHT NOW!"\n\nRepeat the above a half dozen times...\n\nAbout now I am realizing I am dealing with either  genuine looney or else someone too entitled to listen to plain common sense. I try another tact, caveman speech, who knows it might get through.\n\nMe: "Skylight business gone. New business come. You talking to new business now. Unnerstand?" (Ook)\n\nC: ".........uhhh?"\n\nMe: "Nooooo skylight here!!! Try look in fucking phone book! You bugger off now!"\n\nC leaves in a big huff.\n\nIt\'s all about communication folks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT Ok, all replies must be in caveman speak!!!\n\nEDIT 2. Wow! This has turned out to be popular! Thanks for the gold, it was delicious!\n'

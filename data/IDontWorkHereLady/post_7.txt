## How an entitled principle abducted my niece since he thought she was skipping class
#### b'EDIT : a discussion in the comments brought up the idea of epic tales of people getting fired. I keep reading really hilarious stories on this subject in many different subs, like the revenge subs, malicious compliance etc.etc.etc.  so why not give them their very own sub ? /r/youdontworkhereanymorelady was too long, so I decided on /r/youarefired/    \n\nPlease help it row by spreading the word, posting storiesm, make comments etc. and if people wanna help mod it, tell me in  a few days when this viral story has died down, or it will drown in all the comments I get on this post.\n\n\n\n\nFirst a little explanation, here in Germany we have Bundesl\xc3\xa4nder (kinda like the states in the us, but way less independant). Since the school system is up to the BL they often started their summer vacations at different times (the biggest reason being chaos in the highway system if everybody would want to drive to summer vacation on the same day). Also this is not  a recent story but quite  a few years ago.\n\nMy niece is from bavaria, i am from baden wuerttemgberg. Her summer vacation started a whole week earlier the ours, and she came for a visit with my brother and her siblings. It was like in the morning and we decided to take doggo for walk and go to the bakery on the other side of the street of a big school complex. I went in, she stayed outside with doggo, \xc3\x8d came back out and she was gone. Let us introduce our protagonists.\n\nPP :principle pissant\n\nMe : take a guess\n\nN : niece.\n\nI decided to call her on the cellphone, and this was the talk.\n\nN : thank god you are calling.....\n\nPP (Screaming in the background) : how dare you take a phonecall while I am talking to you, you are in enough trouble for skipping class....\n\nAs I later found out he ripped the phone out of her hand, and must have hung up. I realized what must have happened, and went into the school to clear up this misunderstanding, and go right away to the principles office hoping she would either be there or soon be brought by  a teacher.\n\nOutside I already hear him screaming at her\n\nPP : stop giving me a fake name and stop lying, you won\xc2\xb4t get out of here until i have the truth, and I promise you this will be mentioned in your school certificate (we have grades for general behaviour here, and teachers can also write a comment in there. It is something employers care about if you look for an apprenticeship for example).\n\nI did not bother knocking and went right in.\n\nPP : who are you and how dare you just come in here without knocking\n\nMe : I am this girls uncle, what the hell do you think you are doing here ? She does not go to your school !!!\n\nPP : Ah I guess you where the one on the phone, nice try, but you will not help her trick her way out of this. I will get to the bottom of this, and I will only release her to her parents. Now get out of my office or I will call the police and have you arrested for trespassing in a school (school are protected places, so you get in way more trouble here for trespassing then usual)\n\nMe : I will stay right here to protect my niece from your crazy ass, and calling the cops sounds like a really good idea, after all you have abducted my niece.\n\n So I did the call and just told the police that my niece got abducted and to come to the principles office asap.\n\nPP : do you really expect me to believe your fake phonecall ?\n her un till the police is here\nThe  he started to shout at my niece again ,who was in tears by now.\n\nME : STOP FUCKING SHOUTING AT MY NIECE, you will not address her till the police is here, or I WILL shut you up.\n\nPP :that is it, i am calling the police now, to have you arrested and finally find out her real name.\n\nSo he called the police, only to find out I actually did call the police. Suddenly he was not so sure anymore, and you could tell the cogs in his head where finally start to turn.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later the police finally arrived, and they asked us separately. Here is roughly what my niece told the cops.\n\nShe was waiting outside the bakery, when PP came unto her like  ab at from hell. He screamed at her that he is really fed up with people skipping school the last week before vacation starts, and will make an example pout of her. Before she could get a word in edgewise, he grabbed her by the arm really hard (hard enough she got a bad bruise for over a week), and that is what started to get him into real trouble. The cops also took her data, and confirmed she is from Bavaria. They then asked us if we want to press charges and I just said throw the book at him. PP heard the police say\xc3\xadng press charges and suddenly realized he was in real deep shit, so he came over.\n\nPP : hey this is just a misunderstanding, you have to understand I have to be strict with people skipping school.\n\nMe : if by being strict you mean assaulting a  12 year old\xc2\xb4so badly she has a handprint from you on her arm that will create a huge ruise, abducting her from my care, and wrongfully imprison her in your office while screaming at her and scaring the beejezus out of her, then no I DO NOT HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT !!!\n \nPP : please you are completely blowing this out of proportion, I could get suspended without pay over this,and even lose my job. \n\nMe : GOOD, anyody who treats a scared 12 year old girl like that should never again get to work with kids.\n\n\nIn the end he really did lose his job, and I am very glad he did. During the investigation it turned out he was a sorry excuse for a teacher, who belittled kids, who always took the teachers side no mater how wrong they where and even had slapped kids on several occasions. He went to court for assault and attempted abducting plus wrongful imprisonment, plus a few more bodily harms against students. He lost job and pension, got 2 years on probation and 500 hours community service with the stipulation it could be nothing that involved kids. He was also forbidden to ever work with kids again.'

###### b'I know this is more of a "I don\'t go to school here" but it really cracked me up thinking the principal now gets to say "I dont work there"...'
###### b'One time, in high school, we had a half day so my friends and I went to a park near my house and were just hanging out, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still all in our uniforms.  This old lady came out of the rec center and started yelling and screaming that she was going to call the cops on us.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re like ?????\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9cI KNOW you\xe2\x80\x99re all skipping school! I\xe2\x80\x99m calling the cops right now! You think this is cool? To just skip school? You NEED to be in school!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re like \xe2\x80\x9clady, we had a half day. School is over for today\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9coh you think I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid, huh? Well let\xe2\x80\x99s get your school on the phone right now. What are they going to have to say about this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmmm.. that we had a half day..?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you think is funny, now?? This a joke to you kids? I\xe2\x80\x99m going inside to call your school right now and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how funny you think this is then!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(Our uniforms had our school name on them so I guess she just saw that and googled the phone number)\n\nShe goes inside but never comes back out. I guess she actually did call and the school told her that we did, in fact, have a half day and realized she was just embarrassing herself.'
###### b'>PP : hey this is just a misunderstanding, you have to understand I have to be strict with people skipping school.\n\nHow "decent" they get when they realize they are really screwed, I was almost thinking he would kowtow and beg for forgiveness.\nStill, people in power abusing it and using excuses for their shitty behavior is something that should never be tolerated.\n\n>PP : please you are completely blowing this out of proportion, I could get suspended without pay over this,and even lose my job. \n\nWow, not even a "Sorry for being an ass and acting like a power tripping dick to your niece"?Shows where his priorities were.'
###### b'What happened to the dog?'

###### b'Now this is a story'
###### b"What he didn't even realize was this could seriously traumatize her long into her future. Any kind of situation being around other adults, I would be terrified."
###### b'PSA: OP is lying through his teeth, his post got roasted for all the bull it contained on the r/de sub, and he even admitted to lying in this comment [http://archive.is/M0y0o](http://archive.is/M0y0o) (in german)'
###### b'Excellent job pressing all the charges possible.'
###### b'Good on you for actually pressing charges. Too many similar stories end with people not holding the other party accountable'
###### b"If he'd do this I can guarantee he's doing more inside the school."

###### b"Not sure about German laws, but bruises caused by an adult that last over 24 hours on a child is automatic child abuse charges.  They don't even ask a guardian, mostly because the guardian could be the one being arrested.  The state presses the charge.  Recent years have seen the same kind of enforcement in domestic violence cases, where it is adult on adult abuse."

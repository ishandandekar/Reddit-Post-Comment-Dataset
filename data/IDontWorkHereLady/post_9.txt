## ...You mean at this store?
#### b'I worked at Target and there was a Hobby Lobby across the street. I ran over to Hobby Lobby after a shift to grab something and I was still wearing my red shirt with the target symbols all over it.\n\nA 20 something girl comes up to and says "Do you know where I can find a glue gun?" I paused and just kind of looked at my shirt and I said "... you mean at this store or... like... at Target?" And she just stared at my name tag for a long time and sighed a heavy sigh and quietly said "sorry, I don\'t know where I am."'

###### b'> sighed a heavy sigh and quietly said "sorry, I don\'t know where I am." \n\nAwww, I feel kind of bad for her.\n\n&#x200B;'
###### b'I think we can all relate to that heavy sigh and moment of defeat.'

###### b'I work early morning truck at Target and afternoons at Hobby Lobby across the street. I usually wear non-Target-specific red shirts with khakis, then wear the same over at Hobby Lobby. It\xe2\x80\x99s strange when I help the same customers twice a day at different places.'
###### b'To be fair I ask strangers if they know where stuff is in stores.\n\nEspecially the grocery store.  Everyone there is technically a neighbor.'
###### b"I have had days like that. Sometimes the brain just refuses to engage gears, no matter how much caffeine you've had..."
###### b'When I worked at McDonald\'s in Walmart a man came in and ordered a Teen Burger. We told him that was an A&W menu item and his eyes went wide and he exclaimed, "I\'m in the wrong restaurant", and walked out.'
###### b'Wait! No one cursed at you or grabbed you? This is one of the most genuine posts in a long time.'
###### b"Oh man.. I think I've been that lady before.\n\nI know what she felt. As the words left your mouth she glanced at your shirt. Target. He said here, or Target. Hes wearing a target shirt but implies I'm not at a target. Where am I?"
###### b'I really feel for that woman in that moment.'
###### b'I relate with that girl on a spiritual level'
###### b'I had this happen at the grocery store the other day. There was a lady clearly wearing a board head polo and setting up a sample stand. I asked her if she knew where the fresh mozzarella was. She was incredibly nice and took me to it, with me trailing behind and apologizing the whole time. '
###### b'Trying to find someone who works at hobby lobby is difficult, she was probably happy to find you and then boom sadness'
###### b'I was clearly confused at a Staples earlier this year, looking for something and all the closely related things were *right there* but this thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Guy walks up next to me as I\xe2\x80\x99m asking myself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the hell is blah blah at!\xe2\x80\x9d Guy goes, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually at the other end of the aisle for some reason, on one of the bottom shelves I think.\xe2\x80\x9d I turn and look at him to say thank you, keep in mind that he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, jeans, not a name tag in sight, clearly he does not work here.  I see all of this but get a 404 in the reasoning department. I then ask him where something else was in a manner that clearly says I THINK YOU WORK HERE! He said \xe2\x80\x9cI uhhh I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually work here...\xe2\x80\x9d I blinked at him a few times before the wheels started turning, then I turned what I\xe2\x80\x99m sure is the brightest shade of maroon a persons face can handle, apologized profusely, and scuttled away without getting the thing. Still gives me embarrassed anxiety thinking about it. '
###### b'first time i have read these stories the person has realised their mistake and apologised '

## Some assembly required. Good luck.
#### b'On mobile so apologies for any formatting issues.  First post as well.\n\n\nThis happened several years ago.  I was the night time charge nurse over the ICU.  I\xe2\x80\x99d just finished a 12 hour shift at my hospital that had turned into a 14 hour shift because of a rapid response right before shift change.  (Patient responded well). I was exhausted and had to return for a 4th shift in 9 hours.  All I wanted were some items to drop in the slow cooker so I\xe2\x80\x99d have something to eat when I got up tonight.\n\nI stopped at a well known big box store that sells groceries, clothes, electronics.. the works.  \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m wearing royal blue scrubs, a name badge with a big RN under it and forgot to take my stethoscope off so it\xe2\x80\x99s hanging around my neck.  The employees here... well... don\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99m walking towards the store I see an elderly couple struggling to load a large box in their SUV parked at the front of the store.  And I mean old. 90+ Shaky hands. Teetering around with limited mobility. The kind I see with a med list 3 pages long...   no way would his hips take the weight without snapping... and I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked enough tonight.\n\nI approach quickly and address the female half of the couple offering help.   It was gladly accepted and I got their TV loaded with very little difficulty. It was more cumbersome than heavy.  I\xe2\x80\x99m chatting with the woman who is explaining it\xe2\x80\x99s a gift for their son and her husband hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to wait for help.  (I\xe2\x80\x99d wondered why an employee wasn\xe2\x80\x99t helping.). That\xe2\x80\x99s when it happened. \n\nI will be RN.  She will be EB for entitled bitch.\n\nEB:  hey.  Hey!  \n\nStartled, We stop our conversation and look over.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a lady in her 50s dressed in a cheap looking beige pant suit with a get your manager hairstyle standing about 15 feet away with a hand on her overly broad hip.\n\nEB:  IF you are ABOUT done. I need help over here.\n\nShe then points to her cart with two boxes of bookshelves.. some assembly required. I realize she thinks I work here.  \n\nRN:  Oh Sorry.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t work...\n\nEB:  You are already making me late! Just get it done!   ...and DON\xe2\x80\x99T scratch my paint up.\n\nThe elderly lady and I exchange looks of disbelief and I try again. \n\nRN:  I don\xe2\x80\x99t work he...\n\nEB:  Just get it done! \n\nShe then steps away from her cart to grab her purse grumbling about \xe2\x80\x9cFucking idiots\xe2\x80\x9d and is digging for her keys when the cart rolls further away and one wheel goes off the curb.  The entire uneven load causes the cart to topple over.  I instinctively jump forward to try to prevent everything from falling...  \n\nI was unsuccessful.  EB, who has now turned to see her particle board bookshelves spilled out on the cement. Corners of the boxes crushed and one has torn open with a few pieces and packaging now exposed.  EB completely loses her shit and becomes a raging thunderc*nt.\n\nEB:  What the fuck!  You fucking moron!  Pick them up!  God dammit.   Fucking...  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have you fired!  You owe me new bookshelves! And I\xe2\x80\x99m late!\n\nAt this point. I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\n\nRN: Pick them up yourself!  I  Don\xe2\x80\x99t  Work  Here!\n\nI then turn to go inside when I feel her grab my sleeve and try to yank me around.  I jerk my sleeve out of out of grip and turn to face her now violently red face.  She opens her mouth to start screaming again but I put my finger in her face and say... \n\nRN:  No!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me!  Shut the hell up!  I do not work here, and even if I did.  I\xe2\x80\x99d quit before I help you clean up your shit!\n\nEB stands there speechless.  Mouth opening and closing. Sputtering in shock that I\xe2\x80\x99ve dared raise MY voice at HER.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s when the manager and an employee come out.  As EB sees the manager and finds her voice. \n\nEB:  Are you the manager?  This man damaged my bookshelves and is refusing to pay for them.\n\nI just stare in shock.  Seriously?!  Having realized that a man in bright blue scrubs with a stethoscope and a big RN badge really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work here. Instead of apologizing, she chooses to double down on the craziness and now accuses me of breaking her stuff.\n\nBefore I can voice my denial the elderly gentleman I\xe2\x80\x99d helped earlier steps in and explains the situation to the manager.  EB is still voicing complaints but the manager realizes the real situation and apologizes to me and the couple.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m still standing by watching angrily as the manager deals with EB and inspects the bookshelves.  They are not damaged. He offers her two new boxes but EB is now done with the whole situation.  She says no. She\xe2\x80\x99s already to late because of me.  Just glares over at me and says to the manager\n\nEB:  Just load them. I\xe2\x80\x99m already late enough because of this!\n\nThe manager and employee then lift the boxes up and get them wedged into the ladies car.  \n\nAs I shake my head and go to enter the store I\xe2\x80\x99m stopped by the elderly lady I\xe2\x80\x99d helped earlier.\n\nLady:  Sir.  Thank you so much for helping us with the TV. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry some people are so rude.\n\nShe then reaches for my hand to shake.  As she folds both her fragile hands around mine, I can feel something in her palm she\xe2\x80\x99s giving me.\n\nLady whispering:  Don\xe2\x80\x99t look yet. Wait till she leaves.\n\nI slide the package into my scrub pocket and Lady walks away.  EB then gets in her car and (without apologizing or thanking anyone) peels out and drives away.  \n\nI finally enter the store to grab my food items and when I reach in my pocket I pull out a plastic bag with a bunch of screws and hardware. \n\nI realize immediately that the sweet little old lady took advantage of the commotion to steal the hardware out of EB\xe2\x80\x99s ripped box.\n\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.   I had the biggest grin on my face as I did my shopping.  And I have a new petty revenge hero to idolize.\n\nEDIT:  Thank you for the gold and front page!  Had no idea.  Little overwhelmed. Gone from 12 karma to still counting.  Thank you all. '

###### b'Thug life granny. What an absolute legend. '
###### b'Wow, that was unexpected. You could say that lady really nailed it with that revenge!'
###### b'One of the all-time best IDWHL moments I have ever heard of!\n\nKudos.\n\nSlow clap.\n\n;)'
###### b'#K.O.'
###### b'That is fucking legendary, that woman probably imploded when she got home that must\xe2\x80\x99ve been amazing '
###### b"I'm hope I'm half as cool as that old lady when I get to her age! Woo! Go Granny! I have the biggest stupid grin on my face right now."
###### b'This is how you grandma.'
###### b'Old lady got moves!! '
###### b'I thought she gave you a Pentecostal handshake there, but this was so much better. I have the most amazing grin on my face, and that little old lady is my hero!'
###### b'This reminds me of a guy who helped me out a year ago! It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a IDWH situation, just a guy followed me out of my train and went to attack me. Two guys saw this happening and jumped to help me. In the scramble I found a phone and asked the guys helping if it was theirs. After the first declined, the second guy said it was his. Once the man who jumped me was subdued and we were leaving, the guy with the phone divulged that the phone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his. It belonged to the attacker and he tossed it onto the train tracks. \n\nPetty level 100%. Bless these petty idols'
###### b'I am so glad that I am on my own in the house at the moment - I have probably never laughed so loudly at a Reddit tale before.\n\nThis story confirms my own observations that it is far more often the middle-aged than the elderly or the young who behave so atrociously, and little old ladies often rock.'
###### b'I was fully expecting a, "Then she gave me $100" ending. This was an order of magnitude better. I would mount those screws on a wall in my house like a trophy.'
###### b'That was an unexpected twist. Street justice from a nongenarian. '

###### b'This story makes me miss my grandmother. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken something but she sure would have given this lady a piece of her mind. '

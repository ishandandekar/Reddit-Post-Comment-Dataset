###### b'Thanks for doing this before I waited all day to forget about it, /u/Aidoboy'
###### b'I feel it is important to stress this in as many threads as possible. **Actually call your representatives. Do not just email them.** A call is so much more powerful and only takes a few minutes.\n\nLet them know that if net neutrality falls by the wayside so will your vote for them, and you will donate / vote for their opponent in the upcoming elections.\n\nEdit: [Battle for the net will help you call your local representatives.](http://www.battleforthenet.com) '
###### b"No to physical stores!  I'll save tons of money by not shopping!  It's a win!"

###### b'WHAT TO DO IF YOU\'RE A LAZY REDDITOR WITH ANXIETY WHO TRIES TO HELP WITH JUST UPVOTES:\n\nHere are 2 petitions to sign, one international and one exclusively US. \n\nInternational: https://www.savetheinternet.com/sti-home\n\nUS: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality\n\nText "resist" to 504-09. It\'s a bot that will send a formal email, fax, and letter to your representatives. It also finds your representatives for you. All you have to do is text it and it holds your hand the whole way. \n\nWAY too many people are simply upvoting and hoping that\'ll be enough, this is the closest level of convenience to upvoting you can find WHILE actually making a difference. \n\nThis effects us all.\nDO. YOUR. PART.\n\nEdit: Shoutout to u/MomDoesntGetMe for putting this together.'

###### b'For those of you that don\xe2\x80\x99t like speaking on the phone you can text RESIST to 50409 and Resistbot will help you send an email to your reps. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the body of the letter that I sent. You can also use it as a script if you decide to call:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI support \xe2\x80\x9cTitle Two\xe2\x80\x9d net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s plan to repeal them. Specifically, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. This issue is very dear to me and I will be watching very closely to see how you and your fellow representatives respond. Your actions on this matter will reflect how I vote during upcoming elections. I urge you to make the right decision and keep the internet free for your constituents. \xe2\x80\x9c'
###### b'Screw my representative. His message box is always full when I try to get a message through. Probably because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to his constituents, asshole. '

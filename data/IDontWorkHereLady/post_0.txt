## I got promoted while shopping at a store I don't work at.
#### b'So yesterday I was at my favorite local supermarket. I\'ve been shopping there pretty much once a week for the past 6 years. I know the place like the back of my hand. I know most of the employees by name (I live in a small town of ~4000 people).  \n\nAs I\'m standing in the taco aisle, trying to decide exactly how hard to punish my bathroom later (I picked Ghost Pepper salsa, so a lot), I am approached by a woman who must have been 75 if she was a day. SL will be sweet lady, and M will be Me. \n\nSL: "Son, can you help me locate the aluminium foil?" \n\n\n\nM: "Sure, it\'s right up this way." \n\n\n*walks her to aisle 7b*  \n\nM: "It\'s pretty high up, let me grab it for you. Do you want the Reynolds, or the store brand?" \n\nSL: "The name brand please."  \n\n*hands her a 200 foot roll* \n\nM: "Do you need help finding anything else? I\'m a walking directory of this store." \n\nSL: *Hands me her shopping list* \n\nI spent about ten minutes filling her cart with heavy/hard to reach items, and then I got back to my shopping with a smile and a "have a great day".  \n\nAs I\'m standing in the checkout, I see the SL arguing with the floor manager (Greg, he goes to my church, we\'re pretty familiar with each other) over by the express line.  \n\nI pay for my groceries, and walk over to be nosy, and maybe help out. \n\nSL is telling Greg that "The big guy with the red beard" helped her, "I didn\'t get his name" and she wants to see him get a bonus, promotion, or employee of the month, something. \n\nGreg is insistent that no one with that description works there. \n\nI get to the counter, and before I can explain that I don\'t even work there, Greg pipes up.  \n\nG (to SL): "Oh, you mean Mark? Yeah, he\'s one of our best employees." \n\nG (to me): "Mark, this lady has been over here singing your praises for the past 5 minutes. I didn\'t even know you were working today." \n\nMe (Lying through my teeth): "Well, Sharon (a cashier I know) called me and said we were slammed, so I came in on my day off." \n\nG: "Well that\'s some real initiative, how would you like to be Assistant to the Regional Manager (we\'re both huge Office fans)?" \n\nM: "Oh my God, thank you! Are you sure?" \n\nG: "Well, you\'ve definitely earned it." \n\nSL: "See, this is why I shop here instead of Walmart, even though you guys charge more. You care about your employees, and your employees care about your customers." \n\n\nSo that is how I became assistant to the regional manager at a store I am not even employed by. '

###### b'Hopefully you get paid in Stanley nickels vs Shrute bucks!'
###### b">taco aisle\n\n>town of ~4000\n\nWhere is this? Looks like I'm gonna be moving"
###### b'Oh hi, Mark'
###### b"Off topic, but what is it about mexican food that gives some people problems with their stomach/bowles? I've never understood the jokes people make about mexican food giving people the shits."
###### b'Cute story, very heart warming blah blah...tell me more about this entire aisle dedicated to tacos!'
###### b'The manager guy should have given youa discount for your trouble.'
###### b'my local lidl workers all have ear pieces and i go there a lot, before christmas a woman mistook me for an employee since i had ear phones in.. "sorry im just listening to music but what are you looking for? caster sugar? Baking section i\'d say, follow me, yep here it is, happy christmas". it\'s nice to help :)'
###### b"That's awesome. I always appreciate people helping people. And I like the fun relationship you have with the staff. Thanks for being a genuine person. Keep it up!"
###### b"This didn't go the way I was expecting at all.\n\nI'M SO CONFUSED"
###### b'The most surprising part of this story is that a town with only 4,000 people has a supermarket big enough to dedicate an entire isle to tacos'
###### b"The lady's name? Albert Einstein "
###### b'Great, next time she comes in and no-one helps her out shes gonna send a letter complaining to the Assistant to the Regional Manager. '
###### b'As I am enjoying this I just finished my salad, with a heavy helping of "Lord of the Ring" salsa sauce on it. I will not regret it later, have gotten to quit like the taste.\n\nWas at the supermarket one afternoon when the samples were out with a sales rep, and I took a small cracker, piled on the salsa and ate it. she was amazed, as she found it incredibly hot, while I was just saying it was nice and tangy. Around 20 seconds later my sinuses were totally clear.'
###### b"It's always nice to see the occasional positive story here. It really started with SL, who asked you politely for help rather than treating you like a slave."
###### b"How did the sweet old lady not know you don't work there? Old ladies in my small town could recite everybody's family tree five generations back and tell you exactly where you went to school, with whom and what you've done with your life since graduation."

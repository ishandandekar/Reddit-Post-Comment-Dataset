## Husband goes full drill sergeant on a Karen
#### b'Before I start this story I have to tell you about my husband. I\'m French and we met while he was on vacation in Europe, one thing lead to another and now I live in Ohio with him. He is a hard working gentleman, an army veteran of 2 conflicts, and thought he has a very serious and almost hostile demeanor (think resting bitch face, but angrier and on a guy) he is a big teddy bear, quick to make a joke or pull a prank and easy to laugh. He is also VERY protective of me. Since I\'m not here to gush on him, I\'ll go on.\n\nWe were out getting groceries last week, as we were checking out I was bagging up all our stuff because the store now requires that you bag your own goods if you bring your own bags. No big deal. He pays, and I stay to help a very elderly lady behind him bag her groceries and put them in her cart (he had helped her unload them) and we offered to help her put them in her car. She shuffles away from the register and I move to follow, as I turn away I hear behind me "Where the HELL do you think you\'re going?"  \n\n\nI turn to see a very angry looking woman glaring at me. I told her politely that I didn\'t work at the store and I had just helped the elderly lady to be polite and that I was now leaving with my husband to go home. I had never met an American Karen before so I thought this would be the end of it, I turn to walk away and feel a vice grip on my arm. "Don\'t be LAZY! Just do your job and help bag my groceries!"  \n\n\nI didn\'t even have time to respond, she had barely finished speaking when my husband wrenched her hand off me and was yelling in her face. This was the first time in the 10 years we\'ve been together that I saw the old soldier come out, his nose might have been 3 inches from hers and his voice was loud and frightening, "WHO THE F\\*\\*\\* DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? HOW DARE PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY WIFE! SHE TOLD YOU SHE DOESN\'T WORK HERE, ARE YOU TOO F\\*\\*\\*ING STUPID TO UNDERSTAND SIMPLE ENGLISH? GO PAY FOR YOUR SHIT, BAG YOUR OWN DAMN GROCERIES AND DON\'T YOU DARE UTTER ANOTHER F\\*\\*\\*ING SOUND!"  \n\n\nThe the silence after that was intense, a store full of people could hear a pin drop. The look on her face wasn\'t even angry, it was pure terror. She shuffled back to here isle and waited for the cashier. My husband went to the old lady and said, "I am so sorry you had to hear all that, ma\'am. I apologize if my language was offensive. I hope you will still allow us to help you load your groceries into your car."  \n\n\nIt was surreal, like he had just flipped on a switch and flipped it back off.  \n\n\nAlso, we got chased down by the store manager who suggested we could be banned because of the yelling and bad language. Husband just shrugged and said they had better ban the Karen too for assaulting me, and that there are other grocery stores in town, we just go to this one because it\'s close. Didn\'t get banned.'

###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a manager in a grocery store. Something similar like this happened. \n\nA Karen was very rude to a couple, they put her in her place.\n\nKaren then asked to speak to the manager. Said I needed to ban them for harassing her. in my case I had seen and heard everything. To keep her happy and keep her from calling corporate on me again. I walked out behind them and apologized to them for having to deal with a Karen. They were really nice wished me good luck dealing with people like her lol \n\nKaren was very happy she thought she really got them banned . Few week later She\xe2\x80\x99s now the one banned for theft. Finally got  her on camera!'

###### b"Creepy, this is literally my wife and I. She's French and we met in Ireland and now live in Colorado, and I'm a veteran."
###### b'It is common for miltary veterans to have that switch.'
###### b'There is an article out there (behind a paywall) that says if stores in anyway support dysfunctional customers like this their loss is more substantial than if they ban them from the store.'
###### b'I just love how the manager is like \xe2\x80\x9cyou could be banned for that behavior...\xe2\x80\x9d and your husbands like, \xe2\x80\x9coh well \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8fwe can shop at other stores\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like when Karens say \xe2\x80\x9cyou just lost a customer!\xe2\x80\x9d'
###### b'Reading all your comments I realize I simplified the discussion with the manager too much. Obviously the chastised woman was angry and he followed us out to the parking lot to get our side of the story. Husband told him what happened and even said he may have over reacted. Manager asked if we wanted to file a store complaint or contact the police and we both said we\'d rather just let it go. Manager then told us he was going to talk to the other lady some more, but it sounds like she was in the wrong, however he would have to make his own report of the incident and it was possible that we could get banned. It wasn\'t threatening it was just a matter of fact. Husband said he\'d understand but that the other woman should be banned as well for grabbing me. We both felt the manager was just doing his job and held no animosity against him.\n\nSince a few people asked, yes we helped the older lady put her groceries in her car, she didn\'t say anything about the incident but I think she was just being polite. She tried to give us a tip, but we refused and wished he a nice day.\n\nThis morning I showed him all the comments on this post and he actually blushed at all the nice things people were saying about him. He said he doesn\'t think he\'s a hero but he think you are all very sweet to such nice things. (His actual words are \'very nice\' but I know he meant sweet) I asked him how he felt about the negative comments about social distancing or as one person called him.a \'ticking time bomb\' and he said "who cares? They don\'t know me or you or what kind of people we are. I don\'t care what strangers on the internet think, some folks just want to be negative. So let them live their negative lives. I care more about what Biscuit (our dog) thinks of me than angry strangers." Still, he seemed touched by all the nice comments, so thanks for commenting,  you are all amazing.'
###### b'>\t\xe2\x80\x9cWHO THE F*** DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? HOW DARE PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY WIFE! SHE TOLD YOU SHE DOESN\'T WORK HERE, ARE YOU TOO F***ING STUPID TO UNDERSTAND SIMPLE ENGLISH? GO PAY FOR YOUR SHIT, BAG YOUR OWN DAMN GROCERIES AND DON\'T YOU DARE UTTER ANOTHER F***ING SOUND!"\n\nAnyone else read this in R. Lee Ermey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFull Metal Jacket\xe2\x80\x9d voice?'
###### b'When the Karen gets yelled at instead of the Karen yelling'
###### b'Since your husband is a veteran, I assure you that he has met many a karen. We call them dependapotomas in the military, but they are the same thing.'
###### b"You didn't even tell the most important part of the story! Did the old lady still let you help load the groceries into her car?"
###### b"Everybody liked that!\n\nBefore we went 'social distancing' in the UK, I went to a shop (which now has 2m lines on the floor and a huge perspex screen for the cashier) and waited at the end of the 'in' conveyor until the customer in front of me had packed his shopping and left; then I walked past the cashier position to the end of the 'out' conveyor. The guy in the queue behind me immediately walked up and stood not even opposite the cashier, but slightly past her, which put him within about 12 inches of me. I decided he was a complete tosser and faced away from him until I had to turn slightly to pay contactless with my card.\n\nI almost did what your husband did, and now I wish I had. \n\nCan I also say, it's very sweet the way you wrote about your husband in the first paragraph. Nobody would have minded if you had thrown in a couple of more sentences!"
###### b'I had a teacher who flipped this switch once. One of my late-teen classmates was really pushing it, stating that the usually mild mannered teacher would just have to accept his behaviour as there was nothing he could do about it. The teen was broad shouldered and tall, looking like noone in class could be any challenge to him. The soft spoken educator suddenly had this booming voice of absolute rage, frightening all of us and making the bad kid leave subdued.\n\nAs soon as the kid was out, teacher turned around to us with a soft smile and his usual soft voice, apologised that it was necessary but stated the kid really needed it in that moment.\nNone of us ever considered his mild manners a sign of weakness again.'
###### b'Screw the manager. His there too make everyone safe not just jerk Karen. And good for you hubby :)'
###### b'Your written English is excellent.  I hope your husband greatly enjoys your French.  Welcome to America, and f\\*\\*\\* Karens!'

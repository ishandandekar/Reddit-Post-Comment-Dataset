## I just got fired...
#### b'I never thought I would experience this in my life time.  I\'m a hard worker, extremely dependable, and respectful. Not sure how I could lose a job like this.  Especially when I only just got it.  \n\n\nSo I work late and just about every night for the last few weeks at least, I stop by Walmart to get something for dinner.  I usually get off around midnight and stop by on my way home.  Every time I\'m at Walmart, barely anyone is there except for the night crew.  Stocking up the store and doing their own thing.  Now from what I have noticed, they don\'t have much of a uniform.  Many of them are in hoodies or jackets of different colors.  Just to add some context.\n\nI showed up last night and I\'m wearing a hoodie.  I begin to walk up and down the isles trying to figure out what I want for dinner.  I\'m thinking pasta and walk past a few guys who are loading the shelves. All of a sudden, I start hearing this guy yelling.  This voice gets louder.  "HEY!  HEYYYY! Are you listening?"  I turn to look to see what is going on and this guy approaches me.  "You\'re late again.  Don\'t think I haven\'t noticed you walking in the door after 12."\n\nI begin to laugh, thinking this guy is joking around.  Before I can even say anything he jumps on me.  "You think this is funny?  Your job must not be important to you.  I want you to follow me to the office."\n\nNow I\'m completely confused and start looking around like I\'m on some hidden camera show.  He starts to walk off and I turn around and go back to shopping.\n\nHe comes back a minute later and starts to yell.  "You want to be fired? Because if you don\'t come with me now, I will fire you!"\n\nI start to laugh even harder, then ask him, "What\'s my name?"\n\nHe gives me this puzzled look, so I asked him again, "What\'s my name?  Do you even know who I am?"\n\nHe looks at the other guys in the isle, who have stopped stocking the shelves at this point to watch this event unfold. He then looks back at me, trying to figure out what exactly to say back to me before his head explodes.\n\n"Good luck filing the paper work to fire me, when you don\'t even know my name!"  I continue to laugh at this whole stupid charade. I pick up some ingredients for spaghetti, trying to give this guy a clue.\n\nHe storms off and I look at the other guys in the isle.  "I\'m sure he will figure out eventually, I don\'t work here."\n\nThey start laughing and I go on.  Can\'t believe I lost the job I just found out I had in the same night.'

###### b"This is priceless. What's my name? LMAO."
###### b'You need to keep coming back every night to taunt him until he figures it out'
###### b'Guy is frantically searching through the personnel files looking for you, now, you know.'
###### b"I would have followed him to the office and let him go on and on without saying a word. Then ask for another manager to come in and then tell the 2nd manager if they could let dumbass know you didn't work there. If he is going to waste your time you can at least waste his"
###### b"I would say it's mistaken identity but it can't be as if it was he would have said the wrong name instead of not having a name"
###### b"If he's doing that shit out in the open he's probably known for being an ass to his employees. Should have gotten his name and reported his ass to corporate."
###### b'Had me in the first half not gonna lie.  I was wondering what possibly could have happened for a customer to make you lose a job in this subreddit haha'
###### b'Plot Twist: you have a doppelganger that works at that store and currently he is having  bad time.'
###### b'Was going to say this was the wrong sub, then I read it.\n\nI very nearly had to fire you again for waking my sleeping SO with all this stifled laughter.'
###### b"Should've went with him just to see where this goes"
###### b"Reminds me of a time I got suspended from school a year after I graduated. \n\nI worked at a gas station in my home town and had to walk by my high school to get to work every day.\n\nOne day like 20 minutes after I get to work, I get a call from my dad who, while giggling, says I've been suspended. I was like...what?\n\nHe explained that the high school principle called him and explained that he had watched me leave the school to skip class and that I will be suspended for the next two days. My dad put it together pretty quickly and just went along with it. He told the principle that he's not sure what is wrong with me but, but he would have a stern talk with me."
###### b'Quick tip: "isle" means island, as in "the emerald isle of Ireland". "aisle" means a path with something on both sides, such as shelves in a store, or seats on a plane.'
###### b"If you go again tonite let us know what happens. I'd love to hear whether he tries again."
###### b'Man if I had a medal to give... well written story great ending well handled. Bravo.'
###### b"Perfect response.\nRather than telling them, let them figure out themselves how stupid they are.\n\nHonestly I almost didnt read the post thinking this was a story about some angry customer that couldn't get OP fired at the job they thought they worked and instead tracked them down to their real job or something."

## Karen Slapped and Pushed Me Because I Was Ignoring Her And Not Helping
#### b"I am a 18 yr old male, born completely deaf and mute. Also, I am partially blind in my left eye. I live with my sister(28 F) who had been taking care of me since our parents died. Recently she got married and went on her honeymoon. So I am on my own for a few weeks.\n\nThis happened yesterday. Usually, whenever I go out I am accompanied by my sister due to my disability. But now, since she is on her honeymoon, I had to go out alone. There was a new supermarket opened in our area, and I needed some items, so decided to go there and grab them.\n\nMy bad for wearing a red colored shirt almost similar to the employees working there. But if you look closely, you could see that it was not the uniform. I was at the electronics section looking for some batteries, when I see an old man struggling to get some DVD's at the top shelf. Since I am tall, I helped him. He thanked me(I can do lip reading) and went on his way.\n\nThen I began looking for the batteries. That's when I felt someone grab my left wrist. I turned around and a women (in her late 40's) slapped me. She was speaking something, but I couldn't follow her lips as she spoke too fast. However, I was able to catch some words like 'you', 'ignore', 'job', etc. So, I signed to her that I am deaf. Apparently, this was a wrong move because she became more irate towards the signs. Again she was yelling something but I couldn't catch anything. So I took my notebook and started writing that I am deaf and mute. Before I could finish, she grabbed my notebook and pen and threw them away. Then she slapped me again and pushed me to the ground.\n\nLuckily, by this time a store employee came to see what the commotion was about? He saw me on the ground and helped me up. Then he asked me what happened? Before I can sign to him, Karen starts to yell at the employee. I don't know that she said as she was not facing me. After she finished, I sign to employee that I cannot hear or speak. Fortunately, he understood and explained this to the lady. But she is still not convinced. She tries to assault me again, but I moved away. Then I wrote and showed the employee to call the cops on her. The employee nodded and called the cops. Karen tried to run away, but the security caught her.\n\nThe police arrived in about 10 minutes. They first talked to the employee who explained the situation, about how Karen assaulted me because she mistook me for a store employee. One police officer comes and speaks to me. I understood that he wanted my version of events, so I wrote everything down and showed it to the officer. Then they went to check the CCTV footage. Then came back and asked me if I wanted to press charges. I gladly said yes. Karen was then placed in handcuffs and given a free ride at the back of a police cruiser.\n\nThe manager then explained to me that Karen thought I worked there and she became angry that I ignored her. She had been standing on my left side, so obviously I couldn't see her. The store manager then offered me a 50% discount on the products. I texted my sister about the events that happened and she was livid. Oh, did I mention that my sister is a lawyer. She told me that she herself will be handling the case and would see to that Karen would get maximum time. Court date is in around 40 days. I will update about it after court.\n\nEdit: I noticed many were asking about masks, she was indeed wearing one, but during that encounter she had it on under her chin and not covering the nose or mouth. \nAlso, lawyers in india can represent their family in court as long as they are not directly involved in it and the judge is not a relative to the lawyer."

###### b'Good job pressing charges. F@ck her.'
###### b'Holy hell there is no excuse for what she did,! Whether you were and employee or not, deaf or hearing, blind or not, mute or not, no one has any right to lay their hands on you! I am livid just for you oh my god. \n\nI am so glad you pressed charges. That entitled brat will learn that her actions have consequences and she cannot treat people that way.\n\nYou could have gotten so seriously hurt being caught off guard. Are you doing okay?'
###### b'Please do follow through with an update. Thanks for the story.'
###### b'Fuck anyone who puts their hands on anyone else without permission for any reason other than to save themselves or the other person from harm.'
###### b'Even if an employee was ignoring her, that gives her no right to lay a hand on him/her. What an absolute piece of trash she is.'
###### b"I'm looking forward to the update.\n\nRemindMe! 40 days\n\nEdit: It's been 40 days"
###### b'Where you at that no one wears masks and honeymoons last a couple weeks?'
###### b'Karen made no effort to apologize?'
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry this happened to you! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you are able to press charges against her and I hope she learns her lesson.'
###### b'read lips? \nare people not wearing masks?'
###### b'Alright I\xe2\x80\x99m calling it. This bitch is going to completely cry during the trial and beg for forgiveness and state that that\xe2\x80\x99s not who she is and that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be punished.'
###### b"Your sister is the prosecutor?\n\nIdk what country you're in so...\n\nBut in the US, only DAs and state prosecutors handle criminal prosecutions, so..."
###### b'It takes a real evil person to attack a disabled person. Please let us know what happens.'
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need some kind of proof, this is a little too unbelievable'
###### b'[removed]'

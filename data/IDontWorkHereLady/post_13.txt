## This isn’t a dog daycare at all
#### b'*tl;dr at bottom* \n\nA while back I was working in an office that allowed dogs. It was an open floor plan and since customers never came into the office, we kept the dogs food and water bowls right by the front door just because it was the most convenient space and no one else would see them but us who worked there. \n\nOf the six of us who worked in the main office area, I was the only one who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a dog (no pets policy at the apartment) and always felt horribly left out. \n\nTo make matters worse, across the way was a doggie daycare. One day a very frantic woman came in and she had an absolutely massive basset hound with her. Usually the only people who came into the office were associates who had appointments with someone working there, but it was rare they brought their dogs. \n\nShe ran up to me and said \xe2\x80\x9cDo you work here?\xe2\x80\x9d And I said \xe2\x80\x9cYes, how can I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d And she said \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if you took walk ins but I read online I could just drop him off? I tried to call but no answer.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she was talking about at that point and I said \xe2\x80\x9cCome again? Who did you call exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Thinking if I could just saddle her off to whoever she came to see, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to decipher her problem. \n\nShe said \xe2\x80\x9cWell it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now. Look, something urgent\xe2\x80\x99s come up and I really need to leave him here. Here\xe2\x80\x99s his food he likes and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a few hours and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c at this point I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of the doggie daycare. I thought maybe she was a friend of someone here. \n\nI said \xe2\x80\x9cWell alright, can I get your name please?\xe2\x80\x9d And she said her name and then asked if I needed her to sign anything and I was so confused at this point I just said \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I need you to sign something?\xe2\x80\x9d And she left almost immediately.  \n\nSo I took Otis (the dog) to the back and showed him to my coworkers and no one knew the woman or dog. I was worried she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come back, but at the same time, my wish for an office dog had been granted! And Otis was supremely chill. All he did all day was lie around and drool onto his own ears. I just freshened him up every now and then, took him out every couple hours, and he was happy as a clam on a big cushy dog bed we thankfully had an extra of. He just loved attention from anywhere he could get it. \n\nAt the end of the day the woman, thank God, came back. She said \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, you\xe2\x80\x99re a lifesaver. How was he?\xe2\x80\x9d And I said \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a champ.\xe2\x80\x9d And was about to say \xe2\x80\x9cBut why is he here\xe2\x80\x9d when she said \xe2\x80\x9cThats a relief. Most kennels say he gets anxious around other dogs. I heard you operated at a much higher capacity, I was thrilled to see you had so few clients in the room at one time. So, how  much do I owe?\xe2\x80\x9d And that\xe2\x80\x99s when I realized she thought we were a dog daycare. \n\nNow, I probably should\xe2\x80\x99ve corrected her. But I loved my day with the office dog and I did want to get paid for supervising this strange dog all day. I just threw out the number that sounded fair and appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be $20.\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \n\nShe replied \xe2\x80\x9cReaalllly?!\xe2\x80\x9d In this very high tone, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell if I\xe2\x80\x99d overshot or undershot. But she paid me and left. \n\nMy coworkers were laughing hysterically when they realized what had happened and we thought it would just be a good story for the future. \n\nBut the next week... she came back! She said we were so much more affordable and less overcrowded than her other place that she was happy to use us. I was glad for the company so just took him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think there was any way she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have at least some idea we weren\xe2\x80\x99t a dog daycare. The whole ordeal was so strange I just figured \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t question a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d (I was much younger and dumber then.)\n\nNot long after, Otis started getting dropped off two, sometimes even three or four days a week. I was in heaven. He was such a love. And he made fast friends with the delivery guys and visitors. \n\nOne day we took our office Christmas card photo and Otis was over that day, so we included him. In a Santa hat. It was pretty great. \n\nBut it turns out Otis\xe2\x80\x99 owner was friends with one of our clients who I guess happened to have the card out on her table or was kind enough to display it alongside her other holiday cards. \n\nBecause one day Otis\xe2\x80\x99 owner came in holding the card and walked up to me and said \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t even believe I\xe2\x80\x99m asking this but... is that my dog in this photo? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dog daycare at all. This is just an office, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nShe said it with a note of surprise, as though she was looking around and putting it all together for the first time (no coincidence that this was the first time she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in some crazy rush either.) She was like \xe2\x80\x9cThen who are all these other dogs?!\xe2\x80\x9d And I explained. \n\nI was *terrified* she was going to demand her money back, or worse, take some sort of legal action against us for misrepresenting ourselves as a dog care business, or complain to corporate.  \n\nInstead she basically said \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever say anything!\xe2\x80\x9d And I explained we just really liked having Otis around. She stopped for a minute and seemed to be thinking and said \xe2\x80\x9cIs that right?\xe2\x80\x9d And I said yes and told the story of how I was the only one in the office without a dog so loved the company. \n\nShe seemed a little flummoxed or hesitant, understandably, because the whole thing was so weird. She turned to my coworker and asked if I was telling the whole truth (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why she thought my coworker, also a stranger to her, was any more trustworthy than me, but hey.  Strange times.) Coworker backed me up. \n\nSo she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d said something sooner. Could\xe2\x80\x99ve saved me a lot of embarrassment with my friend back there. Alright, I have to get going. See you at 4:00.\xe2\x80\x9d And she left Otis! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it! \n\nI said \xe2\x80\x9cSo he can stay?!\xe2\x80\x9d And she replied \xe2\x80\x9cWhere else could I find someone to watch him one on one all day for $20?\xe2\x80\x9d And off she went. \n\nOtis stayed my office dog until his family moved away, luckily right around the same time I took a new job. \n\nWith all this time sitting around doing nothing, thought it was as good a time as any to tell that story.\n\n*tl;dr - Woman drops her dog off in our pet friendly office, thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s a nearby dog daycare. It becomes a regular thing. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize the mistake until she spots the dog in our company Christmas card, months later.* \n\n*Edit: This was a while ago, corrected a couple minor misrememberances.*\n\n**Edit 2: Thank you so so so much for all the kind comments and awards! I am so happy you all could enjoy Otis as much as we did.**'

###### b'This is the most wholesome story I have seen on this subreddit in a long time, thanks op'
###### b"I love how the woman realises, takes a minute then goes 'fuckin bargain, have at ye'  and keeps on with the routine."
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m cracking up! I love everything about this story, especially because it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I could see happening to me. \nI\xe2\x80\x99m terrible at realizing what people are originally talking about, and once I finally figure it out, I\xe2\x80\x99m even worse at correcting people. I only wish someone would mistake my store for a doggy daycare(& then continue to use me once the truth is revealed), but the chances of anyone dropping a dog off at a retail store are, well, probably about the same as them dropping their dog off at an accounting firm, so maybe I do have a chance! Lol!!!'

###### b'What a cute story! How long did this go on for?'
###### b"This is the best story! I wish I could upvote more than once.\n\nI used to work in a dog friendly office for several years. One colleague didn't have anyone to leave her dog to at one time and she just asked her team lead of she could bring the dog to work. And that started other people bringing their dogs. In the end there were always at least 3 or 4 dogs there. The company now even advertises it as one of the benefits for prospective hires.\n\nI left that job last year and miss those dogs dearly. I do have a dog at home, for now at least. Unfortunately our stays with my now ex after I move out. :-("
###### b'That was a weird but cute story! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that woman took it so well and that it ended well. :)'
###### b'I LOVE this story! About the time Otis was chilling and drooling on his own ears, I was genuinely laughing out loud. \n\nAnd then this woman\xe2\x80\x99s jokes! \n\nBut the fact that she never realized... does she think most doggy daycares have carpeted reception areas, desks, and fax machines? (Just imagining what your office looked like based on other accounting offices I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.) \n\nThank you for sharing Otis with us all. That was magnificent.'
###### b'I love this. My dog is calm/lazy and hates the chaos of doggy daycare, but sometimes we need her out of the house (maintenance workers, etc). Our local doggy daycare just keeps her in someone\xe2\x80\x99s lap at the front desk all day, she would be in heaven at a basic boring office job.'
###### b'This brightened up my day! It was refreshing to read something sweet and positive for a change. With all that is going on in the world right now, on top of the usual negativity that floats on this subreddit, this was a nice change. Thank you!'
###### b'This is literally my favorite story ever. Thank you for sharing!!!'

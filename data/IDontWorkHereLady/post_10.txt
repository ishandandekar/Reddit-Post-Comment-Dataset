## I know it's your number, but...
#### b'Another post on here reminded me of this one.\n\nQuite some time ago, my girlfriend and I (now my wife of more than 15 years) moved in together, and had to set up all the things.  Cable, internet, phone, etc.  We got our home phone number, our 2 cell phones, and we were off to the races. \n\nAlmost immediately, we start getting calls for an establishment that does custom framing and various other art-related things.  Let\'s call them "Expo for Art."  Of course, we had caller ID, and we had friends that would call us, but inevitably if we didn\'t recognize the number it was someone wanting to find out if their order was complete, or their frame was done, of what their hours were, or any of a thousand other questions.\n\nI\'m sure anyone else who had had this happen will recognize this exchange.\n\n"Sorry, that\'s no longer their number, this is a residence."\n\n"Yes I\'m sure"\n\n"No I\'m not giving you my address."\n\n"No I don\'t know their new number."\n\n"Yes I have a phone book, but so do you."\n\nEventually, after a thousand of these, and changing the message on our answering machine to say "This is not, I repeat not, Expo for Art.  If you are trying to reach Expo for Art, please hang up, look up their number, and try that, because we aren\'t them."\n\nEventually, I got my gazillionth call, and I asked the person on the other end of the line where they keep getting this number.  "Well it\'s printed on my receipt.  I guess I\'ll just call this other number."  Any chance you can give me that one?  Thanks.\n\nI call it.\n\n"Hello, Expo for Art."\n\n"You guys are still giving out my home phone number on your receipts."\n\n"Yeah.  So?"\n\n"Well, fucking stop it.  It\'s been at least a year since you haven\'t had that number.  At least cross it out or something."\n\n"That\'s a pain in the ass, I\'m not making my employees do that."\n\n"So you\'re the manager?"\n\n"I\'m the owner."\n\n"So let me see if I have this right.  You, what was your name again?"\n\nLet\'s call him Fred.\n\n"You, Fred have decided that it\'s too inconvenient to cross my home phone number off of your receipts, so you\'re just going to keep giving it out?"\n\n"Yup.  What are you gonna do?  Sue me?"\n\n"Maybe."\n\n"Whatever.  I\'ve got shit to do.  Bye."\n\nI called a lawyer.  Didn\'t really have a leg to stand on.  \n\nI went to the store and asked for Fred.  "Fred\'s not here.  He\'s hardly ever here, really.  You want me to call him?"  \n\n"No, I\'m fine.  I know this is going to sound odd, but is there any chance I can see one of your receipts?"\n\nShe picks up a receipt book, and shows it to me.  Sure enough, it\'s got my phone number at the top, above another one.  I say "I thought so.  I couldn\'t get you at the other number, some guy yelled at me, and I didn\'t have my old receipt, so I had to come down here."\n\n"We\'ve been having that happen a lot.  Ever since Fred decided we didn\'t need two phone lines.  But he had just bought like 20 boxes of these receipt books and business cards, and he\'s too cheap to buy more until they run out.  I\'d hate to be that guy."\n\n"Yeah, that\'s gotta suck."\n\nSo I went home, and hatched my evil plan.\n\nNext phone number I didn\'t recognize:  "Hello, Expo for Art."\n\n"Hi, this is Mary Smith, I dropped off a thing last week to be framed.  Is it ready?"\n\n"Let me check.  Yup.  We finished it this morning.  I hope you don\'t mind, but we decided to upgrade the matting because of the weight of the piece.  It\'s the same color, and won\'t be charging you for it, since it was my decision."\n\n"Oh, thank you.  I\'ll be down to pick it up later today.  What time do you close?"  I look down at the business card, with my number and the hours clearly marked 11-4.  "Take your time, we\'ll be here until 7."\n\n"Thank you so much, can you tell me how much that was?"\n\n"$19.99 ma\'am, plus tax so $21.39"\n\n"Wow that\'s cheap.  Are you sure?"\n\n"Of course.  If anyone has a problem, tell them you talked to Fred."\n\n "OK, see you around 6."\n\n"See you then.  Thank you for calling Expo for Art."\n\nFor WEEKS I kept giving out completely random information.  \n\nHow much is a 36"x48" matted frame?  Let\'s say $24.99.  Wow that\'s cheap, how much to have it done custom, how they want it?  Custom is an extra $10, so $34.99.  Wow that\'s cheap, I\'ll be right down, what was your name?  Fred.  See you in 10 Fred.  How much to have the entire front page of the New York Times from 9/11 mounted and framed?  $33.99, unless you want our special, proprietary newspaper frame and mat service, only $49.99 and guaranteed for life, only at Expo for Art, tell them Fred sent you.\n\nI can only imagine the number of pissed off people who showed up to pick up orders that weren\'t ready, and when they finally were, were given a price WAAAAY higher than what Fred had told them over the phone.\n\nEventually, someone let slip that "they called the number on the receipt, and that\'s what Fred had told them."  Fred was NOT happy.\n\n"Hello, thank you calling Expo for Art, this is Fred."\n\n"YOU\'RE NOT FRED, I\'M FRED!!!  ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT ME OUT OF BUSINESS?!?!?!?!?!\xe2\x80\xbd"\n\n"Why Fred, whatever do you mean?"\n\n"Someone has been giving prices to my customers, and telling them their orders are in when they\'re not due for weeks."\n\n"Well, Fred, who called them?"\n\n"Nobody called them, they called us."\n\n"Then what\'s the problem.  If someone called you, and got pricing information, that would seem to be your problem."\n\n"They didn\'t call me, they called you."\n\n"Well, how would that happen?"\n\n"Your number is on my receipts and business cards."\n\n"My my.  It seems to me there\'s a very simple solution here.  Take my number off of your receipts and business cards."\n\n"Do you have any idea how much promotional materials cost?"\n\n"Is it MORE than it costs to do these jobs for the prices you\'re quoting?  Is it more than it costs to lose customers, or less than that?"\n\n"This is extortion!!!"\n\n"Call it what you want Fred.  The choices, and consequences, are entirely up to you."\n\nA week later "Hello, Expo for Art, this is Fred."\n\n"I\'VE ORDERED NEW RECEIPT BOOKS AND CARDS.  CAN YOU PLEASE STOP THIS BULLSHIT!?!?!?!?!"\n\n"Sure.  Bye Fred!"\n\nETA:  Holy smoke!!  By far my most-liked post ever.  Thanks for the awards everyone!\n\nI didn\'t even know platinum was a thing!  Thanks guys!\n\nEdit 2:  Since a lot of people have asked this, no I didn\'t let him off the hook until the calls stopped, but it was only a week or so after he called me back.  He must have paid for expedited shipping.\n\nEdit 3:  Cross-posted on r/maliciouscompliance'

###### b'I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop until the calls stopped. Even if he tried to use the old receipts 3 years later i would do the same shit.'
###### b'That was just beautiful :)'
###### b'Why, Fred whatever do you mean was the moment you became his huckleberry'
###### b'I saw where this was going and still enjoyed the ride!'
###### b'Oh lawd this was worth the long read.... love your work!!!'
###### b"I did something similar when a chain pizza place had my number on their monthly flyer.  I called the place, manager told me it was a corporate problem, wouldn't give me a corporate contact.  Tried contacting corporate but it was a maze.  So for the next year that I had that number I would accept old coupons, competitor coupons, and offer a rotating daily special like 2 for 1 pizzas or free 2L soda, etc, and pickup time in 10 minutes.  I usually said our driver just quit so couldn't take delivery orders (they'd just call me back), or said we were swamped so deliveries were taking 3 hours.  I also had people call and complain about their previous order and I said sorry about that, this one would be free, just come on in and ask for $manager.  I don't think I ever got someone that called back more than a couple of times, they just had such a bad experience with that chain so went to the other."
###### b"Well Fred making excuses it's cheaper in the long run to take out your phone number out of the receipts than what you are doing that's ruining his business by not doing that in the first place"
###### b'This is finesse. Such good work. You might want to get this framed. You should call this guy Fred, I hear he does wonderful deals.\n\nEDIT: Well this exploded. Thanks for the awards- unnecessary but appreciated.'
###### b'This happened to me, a website for rv rentals accidentally mistyped their phone number on a page. Finally, I asked a wrong number how they got mine, found the page, called the business and told them. They had it corrected that day and were super happy I told them. They had probably missed out on quite a few rentals by that point.'
###### b'You should post this in prorevenge lol'
###### b"This didn't elicit a silent Internet laugh from me, but a genuine real world LOL."
###### b'I have had my phone number 23 years! (I know because I got my number close to when my son was born, so my number is almost as old as him) I just suddenly got a bunch of calls for someone else. The way I deal with things varies by my mood. This last time, I was watching something sappy so I was crying. I used that.\n\n"hello?" \\*trying to hide a sniffle in case this is a normal call"\n\n"hi, is george there"\n\n"No!" \\*openly bawling\\* "I don\'t know how to reach george! I don\'t have his new number, and I dont even know wheeeeere he iiiiis!" \\*crying as if I was georges ex or something, doing that shriek cry thing, and blubbering wildly\\*\n\nThat was the last time they called me for george.'
###### b'Oooh, evil genius. Take my gold and remind me to never piss you off. \n\nAlso, consider cross posting to r/maliciouscompliance'
###### b'Years ago, due to a move, I got a new landline number that turned out to be the former number of a popular bakery.  I would get calls at 2 or 3am from people looking for a status on their wedding cakes.  It was maddening.'

## I'm a teacher. Give me back my phone.
#### b'This happened a few days ago. Sorry for the formatting, I am on my phone.\n\nI work as a substitute teacher at various local highschools, I am 24 but obviously look younger according to this teacher. \nAT = angry teacher. Me = self explanatory.\n\nAT: "why aren\'t you in uniform? And no phones during school!"\n\nI thought he was talking to a student so I ignored him.\n\nAT: "Excuse me, don\'t ignore me." He said as he snatched my phone out of my hand.\n\nMe: "What the f**k, give that back, I\'m not a student."\nAT: "thats detention for swearing at a teacher, you will get your phone back at the end of the day, now you will come down to the office and tell the principle about how disrespectful you are being."\n\nBy this point I thought it would be funnier to let him complain to the principal who I play netball with and watch his reaction. He was raging. Saying I deserved to be suspended and that students always had their phones out yada yada. The principle and I were just trying not to laugh before she told him I was a teacher too.\n\nMe: "now give me my phone back. Don\'t you have a class to teach? Because I do."\n\nI have never seen anyone go so red.\n\nEdit: English is my fourth language, so one or two spelling mistakes seems pretty decent. Also thank you for the nice comments.\n'

###### b"Fucking beautiful.  It's always so weird to be mistaken for a High school student, but this makes it perfect considering you were a teacher."
###### b'I had something similar happen to a teacher  when I was in high school, in that a teacher was mistaken for a student. \n\nWe were all outside standing around near the football field, which is at the front of the school. Someone had a family member or something pick up Dunkin Donuts for them. Up pulls a car by the fence facing the road. A rather young teacher, who had been hired that year or the year before goes up to the fence to tell the car to go away. She was afraid the Dunkin would cause a riot. I don\'t blame her. \n\nOn her walk over to the car and the fence, a coach who was patrolling the bleachers yells down to her, "Hey! Get away from there!"\n\nThe teacher stops, and looks up at him, with a "WTF" face. \n\nMan, I had never seen that coach get flustered before, but he did. He shouted out a quick apology before quickly going back to bleacher patrol. '
###### b'> Sorry for the formatting, I am on my phone.\n\nTypical student. Always on their phone ...'
###### b'We had a REALLY young physics teacher back when I was in high school. She was 25 (I think) at the time, tiny, skinny blond girl (I feel awkward defining her as anything else since I\'m older now than her at the time), looking nothing like the rest of the teachers at the school. One day at the beginning of her first year me and 2-3 guys are walking to class and she\'s talking to a girl (also from my class) further down the hallway, right in front of the physics classroom. We were 10th(?) grade at the time. \n\n\nSo here come the two dipshit bullies of the school, almost two meters tall, beefy twins with the combined IQ of a house plant. One of them sees the teacher and assumes she\'s a student, and slaps her hard from behind. To this day I\'ve never seen someone being 180% slapped so fast in my life. \n\n\nBest part was after all the shouting and apologizing was done to see them walking to the principal\'s office, two huge... "men" led by a girl half their size. God bless you miss Idontrememberyournamebutthatsokaycauseyouprollydonteither, I\'ll cherish that memory forever.'
###### b"That's awesome! \n\nThis makes me think of my Japanese 4 teacher in high school. He looked young and was shorter than a good number of his students. It was fairly funny when one day, a student came in to give him a notice from the office. But she couldn't tell where he was because he had been in the middle of the students' desks, helping them out. She only figured out where he was when he actually walked out to the door to talk to her. (Ah, memories...)"
###### b'When I started working at the University I graduated from, many of the faculty and staff were still working there, including the department of one of my minors. While talking with one faculty member I was friendly with from my time as a student, the one I\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for showed up - so I tried to introduced myself by saying \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Frank, I\xe2\x80\x99m...\xe2\x80\x9d  and was interrupted with  \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer to be addressed as PROFESSOR Jones\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nI felt bad for him when I ignored that and continued with \xe2\x80\x9cOK, I\xe2\x80\x99m agerstein and I just started in full-time IT; I\xe2\x80\x99m the new \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\xe2\x80\x9d (guy I replaced). You were having problem X with your computer?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe got very quiet for a minute, and I could tell he was still confused.... I continued to introduce myself as the new George for about 2 years.'
###### b'I had my phone taken by a similarly \xe2\x80\x9cover it\xe2\x80\x9d teacher my senior year. Granted, I was a student... but it was 5 pm. I had just finished a private tuba lesson in the band hall and was calling my mom to pick me up.  She took me to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office and he was like \xe2\x80\x9cMartha, school is out...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI know after hearing bullshit from kids all day I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to believe what any of them were saying either. But hey, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m not a teacher.'
###### b'I have a friend that is a school-based mental health counselor (as in she travels around to different schools). She got in trouble at a MIDDLE school recently for being in the hall without a pass. She\xe2\x80\x99s 30. '
###### b'I had somewhat a similar thing happen where I was a "guest of honor" for this event at my old high school (after I was well into my 30\'s). I was berated by the principle for not being in class and roaming the halls...right up until I explained I wasn\'t a student but was, well, me. He felt a bit stupid. '
###### b'Something like this happened to me during my first year teaching! \nI am a 5\'0, 23 year old that in all honesty still passes off as a 16 year old girl. I easily blended in with the high school students I was responsible for.\n\n\nWhen our school had a field day where grades were pitted against each other in silly gym games (think tug of war or popping balloons from each others ankles etc.) All teachers were responsible for holding their classes back from the main field. Students were always trying to get closer to the action, even when it wasn\'t their turn to play.\nI was sucessfully holding my kids back, only because my students were a bunch of weirdos who liked to fawn at how small I am and were a bit protective of me getting trampled on by the rest of the school. Lucky me, like all the rest of the teachers I was standing a bit into the field as to catch any waywayrd students so I wasn\'t getting squished by anyone. Unlucky me, I look just like a student.\n\nIn this specific case, a fellow teacher, who I absolutely hated took it upon himself to be the "last defense" between the students spectating and actually playing. He basically went around grabbing kids by their arms, backpacks or sweaters and dragging them back to their assigned place. Well, I never appreciated his method because YOU NEVER ARE SUPPOSE TO TOUCH A STUDENT LIKE THIS. Noooo! Never! \n\nWell guess who thought I was a student? And decided to grab my arm and lift and drag me towards the student area? My kids were immediately wild with rage, demanding he stop touching me, teachers were rushing to see the commotion and this stupid idiot would still not let go of me. What followed this incident was a serious talk with the teacher with the principal, a "heartfelt" apology and groveling to not bring up a case of assault, and never interacting with that asshole again. '
###### b'Only because you are a teacher \n\nPrincipal*'
###### b'He probably thought he was finally going to make an example of someone for the class and you full on bamboozled him. Nice.'
###### b"I had a somewhat similar situation with my wife (at the time girlfriend), who was a public school teacher. I will freely admit that my wife is petite, and certainly doesn't look here age, which at the time was early 30's.  Never the less I was working for a nonprofit that was located in the school in which my wife worked.  One day my wife and I were chatting in my office, she was sitting on my desk, me in my desk chair, we we sitting close, but there was no petting.  One of my board members (who at the time had never met my wife) walked in as the bell rang, so my wife hopped off the desk, gave a passing hello and zipped out the door to get to class.  My board member proceeded to come over and give me a very stern reprimand saying something to the effect of 'Don't let me every see you doing that again', to which I responded 'we were just talking'.  I won't deny that I can be oblivious at times, but I though he was concerned we were being affectionate, and that physical affection has no place in the workplace let alone a school.  Nothing further came of it, and I didn't think more of it.\n\nFast forward 5 years or so, I bumped into the aforementioned board member, and got to chatting and catching up. \n During the time since we had last seen each other my wife and I had gotten married, and so I zealously recounted to him some of the highlights of our wedding.  He asked my wife's name and what she did, to which I responded 'I think you've met her she teaches up at the school'...he got quiet for a second then mumbled 'ohhh, a teacher at the school'.  Needless to say, this guy had spent years thinking my wife was a student.\n\nTL;DR - a board member of an organization I use to run spent 5 years thinking I had a torrid love affair with a high school student that was actually my wife who was in her 30's.\n"

## ELI5: There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There are also infinite numbers between 0 and 2. There would more numbers between 0 and 2. How can a set of infinite numbers be bigger than another infinite set?
#### b''

###### b'I think the problem is you are thinking of "infinite" to be "a very big number".  It is not a very big number, it\'s a different kind of thing.  A similar problem exists with zero, in that it\'s not just "a really small number", it\'s actually zero.  For example if I take a really small number like 0.0000001 and double it, I get 0.0000002.  If I take 0 and double it, I still get zero.  2x0 is not bigger than 1x0.  If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then they are separated by 0.  If I double all of those numbers, then they are separated by 2x0, so they are still separated by 0.\n\nEdit: thanks for the kind words and shiny tokens of appreciation.  This is now my second highest voted post after a well timed Hot Fuzz quote, I guess that\'s what reddit is like.'
###### b'The thing which helped me wrap my head around it (as much as I have) was when it was explained to me that infinity is not a number. Being infinite is a property of a set. \n\nSo if you consider it as a different property - like \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d - it makes more sense. You can\xe2\x80\x99t count to blue, and whether one set is bigger than another doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect whether it is blue or not.'
###### b'Here\'s a way to see that there are the same "size". We\'re going to show that for each number between 0 and 1, there exists a number between 0 and 2, and vice versa.\n\n1. Pick any number between 0 and 1.\n2. Multiply it by 2.\n3. You now have a number between 0 and 2.\n4. Vice versa, pick any number between 0 and 2\n5. Divide it by 2.\n6. You now ave a number between 0 and 1.\n\nThis works both for the case of rational and real numbers. We just constructed a so-called bijection between the intervals \\[0,1\\] and \\[0,2\\].'
###### b'Everyone\'s already pointing out the "correct" way to define size of infinite sets, but what many people are leaving out, which is very, VERY important, is that there is actually more than one way to define size. With your question, you\'re mixing up two different notions of size, namely [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics\\)) and [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). This is the problem that people not into math often forget about when they spout this fact about some infinities being larger than others. If we want the discussion to have any meaning at all, we must first agree on what we mean by size.\n\nTo ELI5, think of it like this. It\'s just like how there are different ways of defining the size of an object. You can take its height, width, volume, or mass. For the purposes of analogy, let\'s focus on volume and mass. If object A has more volume than object B, that doesn\'t mean that object A is necessarily heavier than object B, especially if they\'re made up of materials with different densities, like [steel and feathers](https://youtu.be/N3bEh-PEk1g). To say that object A has a larger size than object B, it requires a clarification for whether you\'re comparing their mass or their volume. You\'ll encounter this need for clarification in baking recipes, for example, where both volume and mass are used simultaneously to specify the amounts of certain ingredients. If the recipe calls for more flour than sugar, what does it really mean by that?\n\nNow, consider what you meant in the post title, when you said that the amount of numbers in the interval [0,2] is larger than the amount in the interval [0,1]. This notion of size is analogous to what we mean by "volume", in the sense that the interval [0,2] takes up more space on the number line than [0,1] does. In math, we call this notion of size the ["measure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics\\)) of the set. It is a little too complicated to explain in detail for an ELI5, but loosely speaking, it is a way of talking about how much space a set of objects take up, analogous to what everyday people refer to as volume.\n\nNow compare that to how everyone in this comments section is explaining the notion of size for infinite sets. Notice how none of their explanations bring up this idea of how much space the sets take, or if they do mention it, they emphasize that it isn\'t important. That\'s because they are NOT talking about "measure", but rather ["cardinality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). Cardinality is more about comparing how many individual items constitute the whole object. You can kind of think of this in terms of mass, though the analogy is not quite as good as that between volume and measure. To make the analogy work, you\'d have to think of mass as the amount of protons and neutrons inside of an object, which is a little silly, but it\'s the closest analogy we really have, given how much weirder cardinality is than measure. But basically, if two objects have the same number of protons+neutrons, then they have the same mass (we ignore electrons, since they weigh basically nothing in comparison). For ease of conversation, let\'s refer to protons and neutrons collectively as particles from now on. Hold on tight, as this is about to push the limits of ELI5.\n\nAlright, so how do we determine that two objects have the same mass, when defined in this silly way? Well, we could count up their particles, and then compare the numbers to see if they\'re equal. This is fine for everyday objects, since any given object in the physical world only has finitely many particles, so you can count them up just fine. What screws this up is if, for some reason, you have an object that has an infinite number of particles. Then, you can not just count them up. What you can do instead, is take one particle from object A, one particle from object B, pair them up, and then set the pair aside. You then take the next particle from A, the next from B, pair them up, and set the pair aside again. If given an infinite amount of time, you can complete this process until one of the objects run out of particles. If in the end, object B still has particles left over while object A is depleted, then we know that object B started out with more particles, so object B has a larger cardinality than object A. If they both run out at the same time, then the two objects have the same cardinality. Notice how this method circumvents having to count anything. \n\nThis is what people mean when they say that one infinity is larger than another. In terms of cardinality, there are more numbers between 0 and 1 than there are integers, for exactly this reason. When you try to pair up the integers with the numbers in [0,1], you\'ll run out of integers before you run out of numbers in [0,1]. I won\'t go over this since it\'s already been explained by others in the thread, so for a good explanation of this, refer to /u/eightfoldabyss \'s reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/h9yh9l/eli5_there_are_infinite_numbers_between_0_and_1/fuzmshh/).\n\nSo yes, one infinity can be larger than another, but what I really want you to take away from my reply is that there is more than one way to express the size of a set. Once you accept this, the fact that one infinity is larger than another will feel a lot less strange.'
###### b'Your intuition for size comes from the structure of intervals, rather than the amount of elements they have. The intervals [0, 1] and [0, 2] have the same quantity of points, because you can pair them up. However, the interval [0, 2] is twice as long as the interval [0, 1]. The particular elements within [0, 2] and their relation to each other is what gives it that length, not the amount of elements.'
###### b'The concept of size that\xe2\x80\x99s used for infinite sets is basically this: Two sets are the same size if you can pair the members from one up with the members of the other with no leftovers. You can do that with the two sets OP asked about, so they\xe2\x80\x99re actually the same size. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that with the set of all integers and the set of all numbers between 0 and 1.'
###### b"Well, two things are happening here. There are different kinds of infinities, some of which are larger than others. However, the number of real numbers between 0 and 1 is the same as the number of real numbers between 0 and 2.\n\nYou can prove this second one by creating what's called a bijection - showing that for every member of group A there is exactly one member of group B. This is easier to show with another set but it does carry over into this situation.\n\nLet's say we're comparing every even number with every even AND odd number. It seems like the second one should be larger, right? But if we take every even number and divide it by two, we go from 0, 2, 4, 6... to 0, 1, 2, 3... That second set sure looks like the set of all even and odd numbers.\n\nThe same thing applies here. If you take every real number between 0 and 2, and divide them all by 2, you get every real number between 0 and 1.\n\nThere is also a way to show that some infinities are larger than others. This one is a bit harder to picture, but imagine a list of every real number between 0 and 1. This is every rational number, but also every irrational, every transcendental, every number that is between all of those forever. It's not obvious how you could sort such a list but let's say you just write down the numbers randomly.\n\nWell, this is a list that you can order 1, 2, 3 etc. Sure, it's infinite, but so is the list of counting numbers. Right now there's no obvious problem; if they're both infinite, you're good to say that they're the same size.\n\nHowever, we can do something that breaks this. Let's create a new number; the rule is that it's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place, and so on forever. This is definitely a real number, meaning it should be on the list, but it's definitely not on the list, since it's different from every number on the list in at least one place. Even if you added this new number to the list, you could just do this again.\n\nWhat we've done is shown that, even if we use all the counting numbers, all infinity of them, we can still create numbers that are not on that list and for which there is no matching number. There are numbers left over after we've used all the counting numbers. Even though they're both infinite, there are *more* real numbers than there are counting numbers.\n\nI hope this makes sense."
###### b'This is actually pretty interesting because there are the same number of numbers between 0 and 1 and 0 and 2. Vsauce did videos that explains this much better than I can in a reddit comment: [Banach\xe2\x80\x93Tarski Paradox, directly related to question](https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA), and [How To Count Past Infinity](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88)'
###### b'The rule is that if you can match up each number of two sets 1:1, then sets have to be the same size.  E.g. the set of whole numbers between 1 and 10 is the same size as the set of EVEN numbers between 2 and 20.  Why? Because you multiply each number in the first set by 2 and you get exactly the second set.  1 gets matched to 2, 2 get matched to 4,.... and so on.\n\nIn the same way the infinite (0, 1) set matches the set (0, 2) by multiplying each number by 2.'
###### b'Those two infinities are the same size. For every number between 0 and 1, you can multiply it by 2 to get a number between 0 and 2. This transformation covers all numbers between 0 and 2, with no missing numbers. There are other infinities that are larger, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to map to larger infinities from smaller infinities in this way.'

###### b"I don't know if its relevant but if you have infinite 10$ bills and on the other hand have infinite 100$ bills, their value will be the same.\nThis is why i love mathematics, still not good at it."
###### b'It is interesting how many misconceptions about infinities, or about numbers more generally, stem from the mistake idea that infinity is a member of the set of integers, rather than its cardinality.  So endless mistaken stuff happens because people have the idea that there are arithmetic operations on integers (or rationals, reals) that yield \xe2\x80\x9cinfinity\xe2\x80\x9d.   The most common is the idea that n/0=inf, but also concepts which boil down to there being an n such that n+1=inf or distinguishable infinities such that 2.inf_1=inf_2 where inf_1<inf_2 (or at least not equal, and distinguishable).  All of these fail for endless reasons, but explaining why they fail is hard unless you can convince people of the bijection with integers (see above)'

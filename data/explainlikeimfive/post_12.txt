## ELI5: How come you can be falling asleep watching TV, then wide awake when you go to bed five minutes later?
#### b''

###### b'The brain is like a group of people talking to each other.  When you\'re watching TV, the part of your brain that watches TV says "Shut up guys, I\'m watching TV," so you can focus without thinking about cake or math.  As a result, the others sit silent, grow bored, and fall asleep, until only the TV watcher part of the brain is left.  Left by himself, he too gets bored and falls asleep.  \n  \nWhen you\'re in bed, assuming you aren\'t counting sheep or something, the entire brain is kind of in free time mode, and any part of the brain can speak up if it wants to.  They start talking to each other, and even if one of them starts to drift to sleep, the others wake it up either by deliberately talking to the sleepyheads or just being noisy.  Eventually more and more of the parts of the brain fall asleep from sheer exhaustion no matter how loud the others are, and eventually the last one passes out and you are asleep.'
###### b"There was a post about this not too long ago. IIRC one of the reasons was that if you're lying on the couch and fall asleep, you're not actively trying to sleep, you just fall asleep because you're tired. When you go to bed, you're actively deciding to sleep, and thinking about trying to sleep actually keeps you awake. "
###### b"I think when you're watching TV, you're typically only passively using your mind. You're just taking in the info. So your brain isn't very active, yet there's something going on to keep it from becoming too distracted. \n\n\nOnce you turn it off and try to sleep, your mind is free to wander and actively think about anything. "
###### b'Since there\'s no empirical answer here, I\'ll throw my non-empirical answer in the mix:\n\n**TLDR: It could be many things.**\n\nIt could be conditioning: You took a couple of naps on the couch with the TV on; now, your brain associates the TV, with just the right amount of fatigue, as sleep time, at the right place. \n\nMeanwhile, back at the ranch (when you go to bed), you\'re staring at your phone, "doing some last few reddits" before bed. You have trained your brain to activate before your "alloted" sleep time. Chances are, you\'ve done so much internet before bed--your brain does not associate bed time with sleep time.\n\nRelated: Your bed should be for two things only: Sex and/or Sleeping. This is to make sure your brain and body associate that with sleep, OR Sleep that usually follows sex. \n\nAlso, digital screens emit blue light. In short, it\'s a light wavelength that suppresses melanin. Melanin is a hormone that is produced in your body. When Melanin spikes up (usually after some hours of nighttime and sometimes around post-lunch hours) it makes you sleepy because that\'s the job of Melanin. They also sell melanin at the drug store, but it\'s always better to rely on your natural sleep cycles as nature intended. The Sun and Digital Blue Light from most electronics today suppress Melanin, making it harder to fall asleep.  **THIS** along with not associating your bed with sleep will most definitely fuck up your sleep.\n\nSleep is still misunderstood for the most part (we don\'t know why we do it, generally), since it puts us at a huge disadvantage in the wild--yet, we **must** do it. This means that even if  we don\'t understand it, it does something right.  Studies where people were sleep deprived had slower time reactions, sometimes akin to a drunk person. \n\nFor example, cell regeneration and healing happen during sleep. The brain, oddly enough, is more active during sleep. There\'s a theory that "pruning" is occurring during sleep--AKA, your brain is getting rid of the stupid, useless information that won\'t help you survive. This is why "The First 20 Hours" method works well for advancing learning quickly seems to do well: reviewing before sleep/reviewing after sleep, in short time frames--so the brain associates that this is needed and doesn\'t prune it.\n\nAnother possible reason is that when you sleep, it takes some minutes (60ish or more on normal IF I recall correctly) to get to Rapid Eye Movement (REM sleep). REM sleep is **ESSENTIAL**. A lack of sleep with screw you up, but a lack of REM will really screw you up. So, when you\'re running on less sleep than usual, when you finally sleep/nap, you get to REM quicker! WOOHOO! LIFEHACK!  **NO, it\'s not**. As stated earlier, sleep has a lot of functions. Anyway, if you\'re tired and fall asleep while "relaxing" watching TV, and wake up 30 mins later, chances are you got some REM sleep. This fucks you up because your body has gotten a little recharge to take you over for maybe, 6 hours? It\'s like your phone was dying, you charged it for 10 mins and got it to 25%. It\'s gonna take some time to get back below 10%.  \n\nRemember those people from the studies? Well, some of them were "disturbed" (on purpose) during REM sleep (enough to snap them out of REM, but not out of sleep). The next day, they felt they were fine and had good rest. However, their results on reaction time showed that they were not at full "normal" rested reaction capability.\n\nAlso, there have been many people throughout history that have experimented with various sleep cycles to "get the most out of their day." I think (and I may be way wrong here) it was DaVinci that famously tried the polyphasic sleep (fancy name for "different ways of sleeping"), where he would sleep one hour every 4-5 hours. Supposedly it worked, and I don\'t doubt he got used to it.  So, you may have gotten used to sleeping 4-5 hours at night, with a nap right after dinner--and you may not realize that it\'s a habit now. You may not like it, but you did to your body--your bod is just doing what you taught it.\n\nThat\'s all I got. Some of it is scientific, but I did internet research long ago and don\'t have the patience currently to dig up the sources. If someone wants to disagree or bring up relevant points, or even call me out on wrong info, feel free. This is the internet, not The White House, I can admit I might be wrong.\n\n\n**EDIT:** I want to add that "humming" sounds can easily relax the brain. Depending on what you\'re watching, if it doesn\'t have much flux, the TV can hum along, much like a quiet lullaby. This is why White Noise or the sound of rain, a fan, Air Conditioner, beach waves, background coffee shop can aid in sleep & focusing. In a weird way, it zens the mind to relax. I looked into it long ago, but I forgot why it is. Probably something with the infant brain associating a smooth sound (singing by mom) that you are safe and not in danger, so you can relax.\n\n*EDIT 2** Guys, gals and all in between--I get it, it\'s melatonin--not melanin. I know the difference, I just have a long-life habit of mixing them up. That\'s what I get for doing a write-up on a lack of sleep. Happy naps, everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\n'

###### b"Because when you get up from the couch to go over to your bedroom, you're up and moving again, which makes your body wake up somewhat.\n\nHappens to me as well. I'm on my computer late at night, feeling tired enough to go to sleep, but after I get up and go brush my teeth, I feel awake again when I get back to my room."
###### b'Entering a sleep state while watching a tv show that you have previously viewed, familiar with and enjoy of enables the subject to fall asleep because of the passive distraction of focus principle. \nWhen your brain perceives something familiar with a known outcome while keeping a minimum level of attention it is easier for the brain to decrease activity and enter a rest phase. The same applies to highway hypnosis and redditing. '
###### b"People don't fall asleep, they arrive to sleep! When you were on the couch, you arrived to your sleepy ways because you were probably there for a little bit, comfy, and hadn't moved for a bit! When you moved to a new spot, your body must first adjust to your new spot, then it can arrive to sleep again =) "
###### b"The ideal window to fall asleep is actually pretty short. Around 10mn. You'll notice it if you start yawning, your eyes sting a bit.\n\nWhen you fall asleep in front of the TV, you may wake up at the end of that window. Then you have to do stuff to put yourself to bed. And the window is gone. And your body had to wake you up a lot. So you are wide awake.\n\nTry actually laying in bed and closing your eyes for 30s next time you catch yourself yawning late in front of the TV. Ez sleep"

###### b"One issue is that while sleeping with the TV on, you're conscious mind is being distracted of the stress and anxiety that you carry with you throughout the day.  Instead it's trying to process the words being spoken, and so you don't have the mental chatter going on.  The problem is that this then prevents you from getting into a deep sleep - so you're more tired the next day.  That and when the sounds are removed, then you have the left-over stresses that you haven't dealt with bombard you all at once, because the artificial distraction is removed.  Basically it tricks your brain into feeling better than it is.  If you spent time process the stressors instead of watching TV - you'd probably sleep better and not fall asleep prematurely."
###### b"Since the top comments seem to be anecdotes, I'll add one too. \n\nI've had lifelong sleep problems and I have participated in multiple sleep studies so I've got a decent bit of experience with specialists even though I am not one.  The first step to correcting a sleep issue is always behavioral conditioning.  You probably often watch tv late at night before bed so you're used to being tired in that situation.  Bed is an interruption to your normal routine so it isn't quite as good as watching tv to your brain.  If you were more in the habit of going to bed to get tired you'd get tired from going to bed, but it seems you watch tv late more often than heading straight to bed.  If you spend a whole day busy and skip tv and go straight to bed, I bet you would get tired easier.  I'm sure you've noticed this.  If it was a regular thing you'd be able to sleep more easily when going to bed.  In my experience with sleep specialists, I've been told to go to bed as soon as I figure out I'm tired to try to make sure going to bed works well."
###### b'Wow I never realized this was a thing, and I do it every night. I finally go to bed (and although I fall asleep very fast) I think about how much I fought it (and failed) during a TV show. I always have to ask my wife what happened. The feeling of the fight is something I wish I could feel again once I laid down. '

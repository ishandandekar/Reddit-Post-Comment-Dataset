## ELI5: Military officers swear to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, not the President
#### b'Can the military overthrow the President if there is a direct order that may harm civilians?'

###### b'Quick reminder to [follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/about/rules#) in this thread and other threads.  In particular:\n\n\\#1. Be Nice  and \\#3. Top-level comments must be written explanations'
###### b"A lot of the Constitution is set up to protect the peaceful transfer of power. Basically, the only way the government should ever change hands is through different candidates winning elections.\n\nSo while the armed forces swear to the Constitution, not the president, the Constitution itself includes a couple of methods (impeachment and the 25th amendment) by which a bad, crazy, sick etc. president can be removed and replaced. Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president, because the other parts of our government (legislature and judiciary) could handle it. The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a.) it's not a peaceful transfer of power, and b.) the armed forces are now in charge of the government, which is bad.\n\nHaving the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose, which is to separate them from the president, even though he's the commander in chief. One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally. His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens.\n\nThis fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome, when (for example) Julius Caesar was able to become ~~emperor~~ dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally, rather than to the Roman Republic. \n\n*Edit:* Thank you for the gold! And thanks to those who are correcting and refining my history. This was all off the top of my head so there were bound to be mistakes."

###### b'In theory, military commanders are supposed to disobey an order that is unconstitutional: no need for a coup.\n\nIn theory. Of course, if said commanders back the President anyway, that won\'t make any difference -- and it\'s not as if there\'s anyone else in a position to stop the military. This is the problem with a standing army, one which the US, in its early history, actively tried to avoid (hence the Second Amendment, which speaks of the need for a "well-regulated militia"). You should probably cross your fingers and hope we never have to find out.\n\nSuppose the President suddenly announces that all presidential elections are cancelled, and that he is President for life. A blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act. What could happen?\n\nWell, if things work correctly, either Congress or the Supreme Court, or both, will put a stop to that. For example, Congress could impeach the President -- effectively putting him on trial, and if found guilty, removing him from office. But what if things go really, horribly wrong. Perhaps Congress refuses to impeach. Maybe the President and those around him have been using personal and direct threats against Congressmen and their families (Hitler did something similar to ensure his rise to the top). For whatever reason, that mechanism has broken down, and those few brave souls who dare speak out are silenced, perhaps arrested or simply dismissed. Can the military stage a coup?\n\nTo be honest, if things have got to that stage, then the rule of law has irretrievably broken down anyhow: doing nothing at all would simply allow the totalitarian dictatorship to establish itself. And I would imagine an awful lot of civil unrest, as civilians opposed to the President protest and are met with those sympathetic to him, and that might be serious enough for the military to impose martial law, simply to restore some kind of order.\n\nBut here we\'re talking about a military coup, and military coups are not often good news. If you\'re lucky, a military coup might succeed in removing the dictatorship, and returning the country to civilian rule as quickly and painlessly as possible. If you\'re unlucky, a military coup simply replaces a civilian dictatorship with a military dictatorship.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold.'
###### b"US Army Officer here.\n\nIt's as simple as it sounds, but at the same time quite brilliant. Our oath is different than the enlisted soldiers (the actual fighters) in that obeying orders is not part of our oath. We are only required to use the Constitution and our principles as a guide when deciding if we should follow an order. \n\nBy virtue of how the oath is written, we swear to place the Constitution above the President. This is designed to prevent the President from being able to subvert the Constitution via the military. The reality that an order may not be followed by subordinate officers is a form of checks and balances that is designed to prevent tyrannical, unethical, or just plain dumb efforts from getting off the ground. \n\nWhat makes it brilliant is that the US military learned long ago that decentralized execution, meaning empowering subordinates to make decisions, works very well in combat situations as well as operational design and our central leaders are willing to accept the risk that comes along with that approach.\n\nOf note, enlisted soldiers have an obligation not to obey unlawful orders which makes them accountable for their actions. But officers have an obligation to disobey even those that could be classified as a lawful orders if it violates the aforementioned criteria."
###### b'Most people who have never served in the armed forces (the vast majority of the present population of adult Americans) have no idea how strongly our veterans feel about the oath of enlistment or oath of commission that they took when they joined our armed forces.\n\nI am 66 years old.  When I was a boy, virtually all adult men were veterans of WWII or the Korean War.  Those veterans all shared a common military experience.  They were patriotic, and they expected certain behavior and attitudes out of other adults.  With the upheavals associated with the Vietnam War, and the cessation of the Draft in 1972, this is no longer the case.  Most adults today do not consider our armed forces to be "part and parcel" of the civilian population, and have never served as a soldier.  They do not understand, because they never experienced military boot camp and training, that our servicemen and servicewomen are taught that they are to *defend the Constitution.*  Most of us cannot imagine a situation where a tyrant might attempt to seize control of the United States.  Conditioned by a recent history of presidents who attempt to do as they please through Executive Orders, many people believe the power of the president is not checked by Congress or the Supreme Court.  This is not the case, and don\'t think for a second that the men and women of our armed forces are not acutely aware of this fact.  As a young Marine sergeant, I saw teen-aged Marines outraged and offended when they believed General Haig (the Secretary of State at that time) was trying to take control of the government when President Ronald Reagan was shot.  They were shouting, "He\'s not next in the line of succession!  It\'s the VICE-PRESIDENT!"  Haig later apologized, but as a general officer and the *Secretary of State,* for pete\'s sake, he should have known better.\n\nThis little story is *exactly* why we need to continue to teach Civics and Government in high school.\n\nAmericans should trust their armed forces more.  Soldiers are CITIZENS, not robots.  In my opinion, the Republic is in no danger from its armed forces.  (Plus, the civilian population is armed to the teeth with 300 million firearms.)'
###### b'If you look at it objectively, the military could easily overthrow the civilian government and install its own leader.  We have the monopoly on weaponry.  It happens in other countries.\n\nHowever, our democracy is safeguarded from this by several things:\n\nSome folks may not realize this but one of the reasons we have ROTC on college campuses is to ensure that future military leaders will always have a connection to the general public.  This is to balance the effects of a dedicated military academy, by its makeup, tends to lean more tribal.\n\nAlso, we also have another safeguard by maintaining separate branches of the Armed Forces instead of having a unified military command.  In the third world, it is quite common to have one branch side with the government while another sides with the rebels.  Checks and balances, if you will.'
###### b'>The Oath of Enlistment (for enlistees):\n"I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God."\n\n>The Oath of Office (for officers):\n"I, _____ (SSAN), having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance tot he same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God."\n\nEdit for ELI5: Dad tells you to fight the school bully who picks on little girls at recess, you do it because mommy and daddy have taught you right from wrong. then...\n\nDad tells you to attack the neighbors friendly cat but you refuse because you know the cat didn\'t do anything to deserve that. Hes still your dad and you can\'t do anything about that but you can refuse to physically commit harm to another innocent being.\n\nAs a former service member with a conscience, I would not follow an order if I thought it would be against my moral compass. We had discussions about how we would react if ordered to act against our own counties people and 10/10 people I spoke with would not entertain the thought of helping with a strike against civilians. \n\n'
###### b"The people on this thread have explained the legal situation of this question pretty well, but, historically, governments that come from a military coup are ALWAYS worse than the one they replace, so I wouldn't suggest hoping for this situation to occur. "
###### b'There is no constitutional allowance for the military overthrowing the President.  Doing this would be an illegal coup.\n\nThe military is bound to disobey illegal orders, however.  Disobeying an illegal order is not illegal.'
###### b'I don\'t know about OCS, but other routes to a commission as an officer include plenty of ethics and morals classes in which they discuss this exact topic, among many other moral obligations. A large part of the answer lies within the exhilarating and suspenseful "Naval Officer\'s Guide", but I\'ll spare you those details as it\'s not quite as exhilarating as I may have talked it up to be. In short: an officer serves his/her crew and superiors, as well as the constitution. If they receive an unlawful, and/or immoral order by their standards, they\'re *morally obligated* to follow up on it/question it rather than blindly follow, for the sake of their crew\'s safety and the upholding of the constitution; albeit, you better be more sure of the immorality of that order than you\'ve ever been before because the UCMJ does not take disobeying orders lightly.

###### b'This is the oath a soldier takes when they enlist.\n\n> "I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God." (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).\n\nThis is the oath an officer takes when he becomes an officer.\n\n> "I, _____ (SSAN), having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God." (DA Form 71, 1 August 1959, for officers.)\n\nOn careful reading, you will notice that true faith and allegiance are sworn to the Constitution and not any particular government office. The only mention of obeying orders (or the President for that matter) is in the enlistment oath, and that it is specifically subject to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So any order in conflict with the Constitution, regulations or the UCMJ is invalid and must not be followed.\n\nThere is no provision for overthrowing the President in there. By my understanding the correct course of action when presented with an unconstitutional order is just not to follow it. Dealing with a rogue President is the job of Congress and the Supreme Court, not the army.\n\nThis is probably a good move, because they are both a lot better at avoiding collateral damage than the army is.'
###### b"There are much better ways to replace the President than the military doing it. Trust me, you don't want us doing it, it sets an awful precedent and the Constitution already provides methods for legally removing the President."

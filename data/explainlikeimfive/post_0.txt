## ELI5:How after 5000 years of humanity surviving off of bread do we have so many people within the last decade who are entirely allergic to gluten?
#### b''

###### b'We are locking this thread because of the high number of off-topic and soapboxing/argumentative posts.'
###### b'We don\'t know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I\'m taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.\n\nChanges in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won\'t go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.\n\nOn the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it\'s entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It\'s also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don\'t know.\n\nTldr: shits complicated literally\n\nedit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which *even scientists* do sometimes.\n\nPeople seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That\'s really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I\'m looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). \n\nUntil relatively recently we didn\'t even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I\'m sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don\'t know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don\'t know much about that. But we\'re learning.\n\nThere is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don\'t think that it will be the same in everyone.\n\nexample: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don\'t, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I\'m going?\n\nWe do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a "fix" but as a supplement. it\'s just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). \n\ntldr2: no really, shit\'s complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don\'t know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal "live a healthy lifestyle" advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don\'t ask for a quick fix and don\'t trust anyone who offers one. Here are some links about the microbiome and a couple on the microbiome and gluten. \n\nhttp://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/microbiome/changing/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiota\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161003113009.htm\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-guts-microbiome-changes-diet/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26605783\n\nhttps://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0295-y\n\nhttp://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/309642.php\n\nedit2: yes, non celiac wheat/gluten intolerance exists. some studies have shown that people who claim to have it do not, but that does not encompass all the literature. the key to those studies is that they were looking at SELF REPORTED gluten intolerance, so basically your average "but gluten" person, not people who were medically evaluated and thought to have it. turns out you just have to find the right people to study (who actually have it). just skim this google scholar search and you will see significant evidence of its existence: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=non+celiac'
###### b'I didnt mean to start a war.'
###### b'There\'s a great Netflix 4-part documentary called Cooked that delves into this. The documentary series 4 parts were titled Earth, Air, Fire & Water, and it looked at an anthropological history of our diets and hunting/eating/cooking rituals. The Air episode was all about bread, and about how it has been a staple of our diets for so long.\n\nTheir postulate was that for the vast majority of people, gluten isn\'t the issue. Sure there are some people for whom the gluten is the problem, they just assume it is because modern bread doesn\'t agree with them because of the accelerated processes they use to make it. Or perhaps there used to be something in bread that prevented gluten from having such an adverse reaction.\n\nIt used to be that bread was fermented. The dough was a living, breathing colony. In more recent years, to speed up the bread making process, instead of allowing the natural bacteria in the water supply to thrive in the wheat and change it - they instead use "clean" additives, such as yeast.  Due to this, there are various nutrients that used to be in bread that aren\'t any more, so manufacturers have also added fortifications in also, to make up for those that were missing and actually have it be nutritious. \n\nTLDR: The bread we eat now isn\'t really anything like the bread our bodies evolved with. '
###### b"Just so we're clear: Allergy to gluten is a thing, but is different from celiac disease. Both are well-defined and different from gluten intolerance, which is less clear. \n\nThe most common explanation for increased allergies is the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that aggressive modern hygiene removes the parasites and bacteria that help calibrate the immune system, leaving it more likely to react to harmless targets.\n\nIt's also been suggested that modern wheat could be more allergenic. The cross-breeding of new wheat strains in the 1960s, which allowed us to feed billions of people, could have selected for a protein variant that immune systems just don't like. Modern wheat processing has also been noted as a potential contributor."
###### b'A documentary was made for this exact question. It\'s called Cooked: Air.\n\nFrom what I remember, it basically said that the way we make bread has changed drastically in the past 200 years (wonder bread, pure white flour, instant yeast, etc.) and that is what has caused people\'s "gluten allergies," not to be confused with Celiac\'s disease. It says that the original way to make bread, with homemade flour and long periods of fermentation, is better for people, and that most people aren\'t allergic to it.'
###### b"Probably the same reason people are lactose intolerant. Unless milk could actually out right kill them, they stay in the gene pool. \n\nI've been drinking milk since I was a kid. Had bad cramps every day. But since every kid eats cereal for breakfast, milk being the culprit never dawned on me. Suddenly lactose-free milk comes out, I suddenly find that moo juice was the cause. I'm sure generations have suffered the same fate before me."
###### b'a little off topic : one thing I read a long time ago in nature before the anti-gluten trend we\'re seeing.  It was an article about fibre in our modern western diets.  and how we lack a lot of fibre in our diets and how the lack of fibre causes the lower intestines to not be healthy, getting swollen and enflamed.  When the lower intestines get to this stage, gluten can and has been shown to pass through the walls into the blood stream. At that point, once past the barrier,  problems occur.  It was a good read and I\'m sure I\'m paraphrasing it way wrong, but what I took from it, because our diets are bad in one way it\'s causing other problems to appear.  And you didn\'t have to have an allergy or Celiacs to see some of the problems appearing.   note: I think this is very different then the trend we are seeing today where everybody is afraid of the "glutens" \n\nI\'d love to find that old magazine or online version to re-read it and see how relevant it is. \n\n'
###### b"Gluten intolerance remains fairly rare, and often not particularly severe. We have higher expectations for our own health now that we ever had in the past, so historically, people with a sensitivity to gluten may have just ignored it.\n\nFurther, while many people relied on wheat-based food products, it wasn't the only diet out there, and only became as dominant as it is now in the 20th century."
###### b'One person I knew who was allergic to gluten said that she was able to eat wheat in other countries; it was only wheat grown and processed in the US that gave her digestive problems. Her grandmother had the same issue.'
###### b"The wheat of today and the wheat of our ancestors is vastly different in terms of constitution, cultivation and processing. It has been hybridized for greater yield, bathed in pesticides and then largely stripped of its remaining nutrition to produce the ubiquitous wheat flour that is in a huge percentage of our foods today. Our bodies have had essentially 1-2 generations to adapt to this largely new food product that has more differences than similarities to the ancient grain and subsequent processing our ancestor's bodies were accustomed to. \n\nAlso, ITT people are conflating true wheat (gluten) allergy with wheat (gluten) sensitivity. These are matters of degree and have significant differences. \n\nedit: sp"
###### b'This doesn\'t account for the last 5k years, but this article has a bit on the history of the discovery and diagnosis of celiac disease, http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/05/24/529527564/doctors-once-thought-bananas-cured-celiac-disease-it-saved-kids-lives-at-a-cost\n\nIt was a mystery in the 30s when it started to become more widely recognized, but doctor\'s still didn\'t find the cause of the allergy until the 50s following world war II. A dutch doctor, "noticed that in the last few years of World War II, when bread was unavailable in the Netherlands, the mortality rate from celiac disease dropped to zero."\n\nBefore that point and before the time period this article covered, people would more than likely die from an allergy to gluten and people would see it as severe malnutrition and gastrointestinal problems but not be able to  determine why. Now we have more information and diagnostic tools to be able to identify gluten allergies so it seems like the rate has increased dramatically when really its just finally getting noticed. '
###### b"Allergies aren't something that dissappear because of natural selection. Gluten intolerance isn't even the weirdest one you can have. You can be allergic to:\n\n- Pollen, which have always been everywhere.\n- Cats and dogs, while humans have been keeping dogs for a long time.\n- Semen. Yep.\n- Water, I had a minor water allergy when I was younger.\n\nNone of those make any sense when looking at our history, but an allergy is (most of the time) just your immune system that lost track about what's good and bad.\n\n"
###### b'It\'s actually simpler than it seems if you separate an auto-immune disorder (celiac), from the intestinal distress, bloating, and discomfort many people experience from bread.\n\nThe processes in which bread is made normally includes a "ripening" time where the dough rises and the yeast digests fully or partially pre-digests for you the parts of the wheat that cause digestive distress.\n\nIn an effort to maximise efficiency large scale, must speed up the process usually by using additives to the yeast to let the bread rise faster and allow for faster preparation times. Even your local baker can\'t let bread rise for 2-24 hours (depending on the bread) while checking it in between, it needs more predictability and consistency.\n\nThe rise of wheat intolerance (not celiac) falls nicely inline with mechanisation of the production line of bread products.'
###### b'Reddit has a weird hate boner about gluten, so a lot of folks are going to tell you the rise in allergies is psychosomatic. [That\'s not true:](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain) \n\n> For reasons that remain largely unexplained, the incidence of celiac disease has increased more than fourfold in the past sixty years. Researchers initially attributed the growing number of cases to greater public awareness and better diagnoses. But neither can fully account for the leap since 1950. Murray and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic discovered the increase almost by accident. Murray wanted to examine the long-term effects of undiagnosed celiac disease. To do that, he analyzed blood samples that had been taken from nine thousand Air Force recruits between 1948 and 1954. The researchers looked for antibodies to an enzyme called transglutaminase; they are a reliable marker for celiac disease. **Murray assumed that one per cent of the soldiers would test positive, matching the current celiac rate. Instead, the team found the antibodies in the blood of just two-tenths of one per cent of the soldiers.** Then they compared the results with samples taken recently from demographically similar groups of twenty- and seventy-year-old men. In both groups, the biochemical markers were present in about one per cent of the samples.\n\nThe whole article is interesting, and it\'s well reported (it\'s from the New Yorker, not some sketchy clickbait "GlutenAlert365.com" meme your aunt posts on Facebook).

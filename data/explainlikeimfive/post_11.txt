## ELI5 If diamonds and other gemstones can be lab created, and indistinguishable from their naturally mined counterparts, why are we still paying so much for these jewelry stones?
#### b'EDIT: Holy cow!!! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect my question to blow up with so many helpful answers. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to respond and comment. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned A LOT from the responses and we will now be considering moissanite options. My question came about because we wanted to replace stone for my wife\xe2\x80\x99s  pendant necklace. After reading some of the responses together, she\xe2\x80\x99s turned off on the idea of diamonds altogether. Thank you also to those who gave awards. It\xe2\x80\x99s truly appreciated!'

###### b'Oddly enough, there is actually a huge discrepancy between natural and synthetic rubies, sapphires, and emeralds (among others) but the price gap hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened with diamonds yet. \n\nThe entire natural diamond world is trying their best to keep prices high though. Really interesting time to be in the industry'

###### b'Marketing and monopoly.  Diamonds are not unique or rare on this planet.  The DeBeers corporation has a long standing monopoly, and an incredible marketing campaign stressing that you should spend 2 months salary on a ring if you really love your future wife.  \n\nTruth be told, lab grown diamonds are so perfect at this point, that DeBeers is spending millions trying to figure out how to tell the difference.'

###### b"DeBeers does not have a monopoly any longer. Canada and Russia have taken claim to alk their diamond mines.\n\nThe status of a natural diamond is the only thing that keeps them 'valuable'. The vast majority of diamonds mined are industrial grade which does limit the amount of natural diamonds. Also the fact that DeBeers limited the amount of diamonds released to the public inflated the price.\n\nA friend of mine had his mother cremated and her ashes to be turned into a diamond. The diamond was later encased in an apoxy that was colored a shade of amber."

###### b"I'm an exploration geologist, I don't work in diamonds though. But the statement that diamonds are not unique or rare is a common trope on reddit and kinda bullshit.\n\nThe conditions under which diamonds form are rare, they grow at great depths at the base of the earths crust where carbon can form in a stable environment to produce a diamond. We don't see many rocks from this depth, rare examples occur but in my 20 years I have only visited a single locality where I could look at mantle rocks. \n\nDiamonds then need to be brought to the Earths surface rapidly, over the course of days, in order for them to not start to reequalise with their new pressure and temperature conditions, this occurs through a sorta weird magmatic eruption in a diatreme like eruption in a rock called a kimberlite. Kimberlites are narrow, relatively small, do not have a large surface expression. The diamonds are then are relatively minor accessory mineral component within the kimberlite. Then you have to think the majority of diamonds are industrial and not gem quality. I have in my 20 years never mapped, sampled or visited a kimberlite.\n\nReal diamonds are rare, gem quality even rarer. They form under common conditions that we rarely ever see at surface. Diamonds are rare as fuck. If that rareity is something to you then you can place a value on it."
###### b"There's a very big company that owns almost all diamond mining operations around the world. Diamonds aren't actually that rare or hard to get compared to most other natural materials. The company makes the price go up because they want more money. Because they own all the diamonds no other company can attract customers with a better price. \n\nAs for why artificial diamonds are still expensive, the answer is they arent, at least compared to the price of natural diamonds. From what I understand, the new artificial gemstones still require the same processes to determine shape, cut, color, carat weight (a fancy way of measuring how big a gem is), and clarity are mostly the same as with natural diamonds. The steps to make it look nice are what you're actually paying for. This usually comes out to less than half as much as a natural diamond of similar quality would cost."

###### b'Right, my comment is either going to get down voted to oblivion or not seen at all, but I\'ll say this anyway.\n\nWhy do we pay so much for natural diamonds and gemstones:\nAnother redditor touched on this, but a big chunk of the price tag comes from getting that raw stone from mine to market.\n\n1) You can\'t predict mining, you can take a highly educated guess at where the vein is that contains the gems, but you can still get it wrong and either way that costs $$$\n2) The effort that goes into it, these a huge fkn operations with big machinery and running costs to boot\n3) You\'ve finally got enough gemstones (yay). These get sold to a rough diamond broker. When the mine sells to the broker, the mine needs to make a profit.\n4) The rough broker then sells to a gemstone cutter for a profit\n5) The cutter then cuts the gems and sells them for a profit to a jewelry designer.\n6) The designer does their thing, sells for a profit to a jewelry manufacturer. \n7) Sell for profit to a wholesaler\n8) Sells for profit to a retailer (Jared, Kay etc)\n9) Sells for a profit to the consumer.\n\nIts consumerism. Yes marketing is a big part of it, but newsflash - marketing and sales are a part of EVERYTHING.\n\nAs for "Above Ground" (Lab Created). Its quicker to produce and less impact on the environment. But again, you still need equipment,, machinery etc set up to grow the gemstones. As well, the gemstone still needs to go through the same same process (cutting, polishing, designing, setting etc), so you haven\'t eliminated those costs either.\n\nAt the end of the day it comes down to a few things: \n1) The price difference isn\'t that much when you compare the two. You may save a few thousand, but nothing crazy.\n2) PREFERENCE - Some people prefer the romance behind natural diamonds and gemstones, which is 100% ok. Some people would prefer to have something grown above ground with less impact on the environment, totally fine too. Both will make the respective consumer happy. This also keeps both markets alive\n3) If you\'ve managed to read this far, thanks. Pro tip of you REALLLY wanna save $ when buying diamonds/ gemstones. Cut out all the middle men. Find a company who buys direct from the source (you can check this up online under "DeBeers Sightholders") and does all the work in-house. This saves you THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS.\n\nSource: I work in the luxury goods industry as a Personal Shopper. This is how I bought my engagement ring for my fiance. This is also how I have saved my clients from overpaying when shopping'

## ELI5: How did we get to the point where laptops and smartphones are in the same price range?
#### b''

###### b'The difference is that most people are buying the top spec smartphones ($1000+), but not nearly as many people buy top spec laptops ($2500+).'
###### b"Demand for fancier phones with bigger screens and better cameras = higher cost, more people willing to pay for them.\n\nThat being said, this is only true if you're comparing very specific subsets of price ranges. Laptops are still notably more expensive. Unless you're say, comparing a middle of the road phone to a low end laptop which isn't really a fair comparison.\n\nLooking at only big namebrands here to remove extreme outliers.\n\nA low-end smartphone (Samsung Galaxy A10) might be $120. A low-end laptop (Asus Chromebook C523) might be $240.\n\nA top-end smartphone (iPhone XS Max) might be $1500. A top-end laptop might be anywhere from $2500 for a more general purpose high-performer (High end macbook pro) or $3200+ for a high-end gaming laptop with a high-end display (ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX701)"
###### b"A smartphone is a handheld computer that does most of the computing you need at any given moment of the day, occasionally you can use it to make phone calls.  A laptop is a more powerful computer, usually, that allows you to do the stuff you can't do with the smartphone.  You pay what you pay for a smartphone for the convenience and you pay what you do for a laptop for what it offers.\n\nI like having a computer that can also make phone calls in my pocket throughout the day, having a laptop for school/work, and having a desktop setup for everything else."
###### b'Related: wtf do smart phones even *do* that requires being "top spec". \n\nBrowse web. \n\nHaving a sweet camera is a thing I can understand, but a thousand bucks?'

###### b'Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t smartphones getting cheaper?  I remember buying my first big screen TV, a 1080p 50\xe2\x80\x9d plasma for almost $2k.  Now all TV\xe2\x80\x99s are much better and much cheaper.  Smartphones? The iPhone I bought years ago was cheaper than the iPhones now.  Maddening.'
###### b"Most consumers don't know about ram, rom, storage, processor speed.\n\nSo instead most people buy the new brand-name with the bigger number. \n\nYou can get relatively cheap phones and computers if you buy based on the actual specs instead of whatever is being marketed as new."
###### b'I have a Note 9 with dock, mouse, keyboard, HDMI, and external hard drive. Also available with 8 gigs of RAM. Phones blow my mind especially as a custom PC guy. I used to get real excited for an upgrade that was nothing compared to this phone.'
###### b'You pay for performance and portability. Laptops cost more than their performance equivalent desktops because smaller and more specialized parts are required to get the performance. More technology tends to go into them as well. Phones are the same way. More technology goes into your phone than probably anything else you deal with on a daily basis. That combined with the fact that smart phones are now the most portable computer we carry and use, and we no longer get carrier subsidies like we used to for signing two year contracts have made price you pay for the phone go up.'
###### b"You're comparing high-end smartphones with mid and low end laptops. It isn't the same market.\n\nBut from an objective standpoint, the smartphones of today can fill many of the same functions as the laptops of old. And so it makes sense that they have risen in price."
###### b'As has been pointed out, they really aren\xe2\x80\x99t. But phones probably should cost more. \n\n1. Miniaturization is expensive. \n2. Phones need cellular modems. \n3. Phones need better cameras. \n4. Phones have higher pixel density. \n5. Phones need GPS. \n6. Phones are getting waterproofing. \n7. Phones need to be more durable. \n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bunch of other stuff that make phones way more impressive from an engineering POV. Laptops really only come with bigger versions of the same components which often isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually that costly. Laptops have more connectors and a physical keyboard, but those aren\xe2\x80\x99t super expensive either.'
###### b'It is easy, because we pay for them. If apple came out with a 1500 dollar phone and not 1 person bought it what do you think would happen. They would have to lower the price it is that simple. Since the 1500 dollar phone would have thousands of idiots lined up outside to buy it they charge that much for it. Quit buying them as a whole and we gain the power back.'
###### b'IMHO Apple had the brilliant idea of marketing and positioning their technical products as must-have status symbol fashion accessories. Certain people were willing to pay silly prices for gadgets that were technically not worth their asking price. Then others decided to follow.  \n  \nI recently upgraded to a $100 octa core phone with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and it\'s covering all my needs, including remote connecting to client PCs for maintenance.  \n  \nQuite a few people I know that buy $1k phones just use them to surf the net/Facebook. They justify spending the money because they spend "a lot of time on the phone", i.e. making calls, when call-making is probably the only feature that hasn\'t improved since pre-smartphones.\n  \n  \nBut at least they live up to society\'s measurement of social value.'
###### b'What are you actually asking about OP? Why are phones so expensive? Why are laptops so cheap?\n\nThe drive for more features in phones has been very strong over the past 10+ years. At this point a phone can do everything a laptop can, but is limited by OS and screen size. I can actually doc my phone over usbc, hook a larger screen and mouse and keyboard to it and use it like a PC.\n\nThe drive for laptops has been to provide a larger spectrum of options. Some being super light weight, others being very powerful, and some going cost above all else. There is way more diversity in laptops than in phones, making some from name brands cheaper than a phone.\n\nThe real question here is when is that line between phone and laptop going to be so blurred we will struggle to define it?'
###### b'You, the consumer. \n\nDemand and your wallet is what allowed these devices to exist at thier price ranges. \n\nAnd its hella complicated tech yo.'

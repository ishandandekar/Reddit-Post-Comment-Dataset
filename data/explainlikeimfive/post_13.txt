## ELI5: How did Germany stop being Nazis after the end of WWII? Did everyone just "snap out of it" after Hitler's death?
#### b''

###### b"Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm going to have to lock this post. I know people hate that, and fairly so. ELI5 is an objective and impartial community, we literally have rules specifically banning soapboxing and any non objective topics.\n\nIt is very clear that this topic has both a. been addressed well, and b. is a topic that people cannot restrain themselves from veering into modern politics, particularly US politics. This is not the place for it.\n\nI hope you all enjoy the learning that is still here, and you can let us know in mod mail if you have any questions (but please don't message us because you had a comeback you really wanted to make to someone on the other side of america's bizarre team sport version of politics)."
###### b'Time and silence.  \n\nFor 13 years, almost all of the elite had to join the Nazi party.  In 1952, 25% of West Germans admitted to having a "good opinion" of Hitler.  In his first official address to the parliament, Chancellor Adenauer (in 1949) said "The government of the Federal Republic, in the belief that many have subjectively atoned for a guilt that was not heavy, is determined where it appears acceptable to do so to put the past behind us."  The German government was generally determined to forget.  \n\nIn 1968, Germany had its own set of internal revolutions, where the baby boom children grew up and protested against the crimes of their fathers, so to speak.  This was helped along by the fact that the actual chancellor, the third in the history of West Germany, was himself a former Nazi and a party member from 1933-1945 who served under Ribbentrop.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Georg_Kiesinger#Early_life_and_Nazi_activities\n\nThey made it illegal to continue to be a Nazi or to support Hitler, but for the most part, if you were a Nazi and said "sorry about all that Nazi stuff" the German government was fine with it.'

###### b'There\'s an old German joke and the gist of it is "Who were the Nazis" and the punchline is "someone else\'s grandfather."  The joke is that clearly many, many people\'s grandfathers were Nazis, but never yours!\n\nIt wasn\'t like everyone "woke up" and realized they\'d been evil Nazis and stopped thinking those things, they just didn\'t have power any longer because they were literally destroyed by foreign armies.\n\nThey never stopped being Nazis they just lost the ability to be public Nazis.  Maybe some of them changed their minds after seeing the results of the war, maybe a lot did, but plenty didn\'t too and they didn\'t go anywhere.'
###### b"There were a lot of politicians the Nazis had arrested or removed from office.  The first leader of West Germany had spent time in a Nazi prison. The US and the Allies had a specific 'De-Nazification' program they used.  It included things like forcing Germans to visit the death camps."
###### b'In addition to what\xe2\x80\x99s been mentioned above, in Germany they teach about the Holocaust. They don\xe2\x80\x99t try and pretend it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen or that it was just a few ppl participating. They take full blame and teach how it was wrong.'
###### b"A lot of people didn't stop. They just stopped talking about the past. Or they talked about their views only in private.\n\nAlso, a lot of powerful people just kept their influence, and the institutions they worked for helped them by keeping quiet so as not to draw negative public scrutiny to the institutions past (there were a lot of outspoken Nazis in academia for example).\n\nAt some point it was then decided that the matter was dealt with and a thing of the past, but in reality victims often did not get justice, and their neighbors still had kept their racist views, and did not treat them better then before.\n\nAt least that is what happened where I am from."
###### b"Read up on Dreher's Law... Aside from everything else that's been commented on, much of the postwar law hindered and buried a lot of the past because Nazi judges and lawyers, themselves not held directly responsible for war crimes, had architected the law and continued to serve in the German legal system.\n\nSo it took a very long time to hold these people to account and purge these remnants, to prevent them from continuing to influence German society."
###### b"Not at all\n\nBoth east and west Germany had tons of Nazis after\n\nWell into the 60s, many judges etc were nazi supporters\n\nThere's actually quite a bit of info on it, I'd watch the documentary the accountant of Auschwitz  it's a very good film but quite devastating"

###### b"One really important thing was the Marshall Plan. After WWI the Germans were punished and put in an economic situation that made Hitler's nationalism attractive. So after WWII, the Americans poured a lot of money into rebuilding Germany. This made it much more attractive to give up on the Nazi failure and become part of a more cooperative European and world order."
###### b"Germany was full of Nazi supporters after the war. They just weren't in a position to say or do anything about it. The country was [occupied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany), its leaders were executed or imprisoned, it was not allowed to have a military until 1955, and it was split into two opposing halves until 1990. The people who emerged from all that were essentially denazified."
###### b'They abolished the party and made it illegal to be a Nazi. They also tried the leaders for war crimes.'
###### b'It was an extensive process of education on the part of the allies and the Russians of average Germans, also holding Nazi leaders accountable'

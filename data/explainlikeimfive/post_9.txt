## ELI5 remembers u/bossgalaga
#### b'Hi Everyone,\n\nWe have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:\n\n[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)\n\n[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)\n\nWe are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.\n\nAdditionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, "...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored." This, of course, led to the start of r/explainlikeimfive. If you\'re interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)\n\nThank you all for the kind words thus far. u/bossgalaga\'s friends and family certainly will appreciate them.'

###### b'Anyone who would like to post a nice message may do so. We will manually approve any that pass rule 1 and are in good faith/on topic. You will still get a removal message it will go back up shortly (we cannot disable that feature for a single post)'
###### b'RIP. This sub was one of the first I started reading on reddit way back when. He came up with a great idea that really showed how cool this website could be.'
###### b"Anyone who has spent time on this sub knows that it can be one of the best on Reddit when it comes to fostering learning, and we wouldn't have that without /u/bossgalaga. I hope that we as a community can continue to keep that spirit alive and make this sub the best it can be, and hope that /u/bossgalaga will be proud of it."
###### b'RIP, u/bossgalaga, your subreddit has made me less stupid than I used to be <3'
###### b'I\'ve been a mod of ELI5 for 8 years, and have around since nearly the beginning.  I didn\'t interact a ton with bossgalaga, but when I did he was always excited about how the sub had progressed, and was happy that what he had started was a place where people could expect civility.  That\'s why our #1 rule has always been "Be Nice" and I think it makes for a great community.\n\nI appreciate everyone who\'s contributed questions, explanations, or helped in maintaining the community every year, and I\'m thankful that a community with this vision was created so we could all enjoy it.\n\nRIP boss!  We\'ll keep the lights on here.'
###### b'I remember finding this sub and thinking "Fuck, that\'s a really good idea, actually, this is EXACTLY what the internet should be for"\n\nI\'ve learned a shit-ton over the years here, and my life is more interesting and vibrant for it.\n\nSo, if u/bossgalaga \'s family is reading, know that his life legacy included making one random dude in DC\'s life a little bit nicer and more fun.\n\nThat doesn\'t suck, at all.'
###### b'Great post, great subreddit, great dude. Can we get this legend referenced in the ELI5 banner or something? \nLest we forget'
###### b"I started an ELI5 chatroom in our company chat where the employees can ask questions about things they want to know without being judged it feeling dumb, based on this subreddit. u/bossgalaga may not have invented the idea, but it's where I learned about it and it's made us an organization with better trained people as a result. You're leaving behind a great legacy, friend. RIP."
###### b'RIP u/bossgalaga. With almost 20MM members, at least his legacy lives on. Love the sub'
###### b"[It's crazy that he's passed, and we're receiving this news, exactly 10 years, and one day after the sub was founded.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/) \n\nSorry to hear of his passing."
###### b'Poor mate, terribly sad news. I still remember the thread where someone suggested it and bossgalaga made it happen. See you in Valhalla bud.'
###### b'RIP. Truly gives my condolences to family and friends. I have learned many things here easily due to my circumstances. Very grateful for this community.'
###### b"Wow... I didn't know /u/bossgalaga, but ELI5 has become a vital part of what I consider Reddit to be. They may be gone, but their contribution will live on."
###### b'RIP man. I love this sub. I was unable to follow my dream of being a teacher, and it allows me to scratch that itch while helping people out.'
###### b'One of the best sub reddits. It has inspired many young people to pursue their curiosity in the sciences. Never knew who is behind the username, but he will be remembered. Rip u/bossgalaga'

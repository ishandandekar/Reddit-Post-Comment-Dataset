#### b'Please use this thread to ask any questions regarding the recent data leak.\n\nEither use this thread to provide general explanations as direct replies to the thread, or as a forum to pose specific questions and have them answered here.'

###### b"Hi there,\n\n\nWe've decided to lock this thread due to the large and constant influx of questions invoking speculation/debate as well as the amount of biased or low effort comments ([rules 2, 3, 5 and 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/about/rules/)), which makes moderating it incredibly time consuming.\n\n\nFrom what we can see, many quality questions and explanations have been posted here, so we will not be removing this thread.\n\n\nA new subreddit has been created strictly for news, questions and discussion about the Panama Papers (/r/PanamaPapers). We invite you to continue asking questions and discussing the matter there.\n\n\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n\n-*ELI5 Modteam*\n\n\n\n"

###### b'When you get a quarter you put it in the piggy bank. The piggy bank is on a shelf in your closet. Your mom knows this and she checks on it every once in a while, so she knows when you put more money in or spend it. \n\nNow one day, you might decide "I don\'t want mom to look at my money." So you go over to Johnny\'s house with an extra piggy bank that you\'re going to keep in his room. You write your name on it and put it in his closet. Johnny\'s mom is always very busy, so she never has time to check on his piggy bank. So you can keep yours there and it will stay a secret.\n\nNow all the kids in the neighborhood think this is a good idea, and everyone goes to Johnny\'s house with extra piggy banks. Now Johnny\'s closet is full of piggy banks from everyone in the neighborhood.\n\nOne day, Johnny\'s mom comes home and sees all the piggy banks. She gets very mad and calls everyone\'s parents to let them know.\n\nNow not everyone did this for a bad reason. Eric\'s older brother always steals from his piggy bank, so he just wanted a better hiding spot. Timmy wanted to save up to buy his mom a birthday present without her knowing. Sammy just did it because he thought it was fun. But many kids did do it for a bad reason. Jacob was stealing people\'s lunch money and didn\'t want his parents to figure it out. Michael was stealing money from his mom\'s purse. Fat Bobby\'s parents put him on a diet, and didn\'t want them to figure out when he was buying candy.\n\nNow in real life, many very important people were just caught hiding their piggy banks at Johnny\'s house in Panama. Today their moms all found out. Pretty soon, we\'ll know more about which of these important people were doing it for bad reasons and which were doing it for good reasons. But almost everyone is in trouble regardless, because it\'s against the rules to keep secrets no matter what.'
###### b'Who are the people that are involved for sure ? '

###### b"My ELI5:\n\nMessi: hey gov, I can't pay 10 mil in taxes man.\n\nGov: why? \n\nMessi: I'm investing in this company so most of my income is spent already. I have barely any left.\n\nGov: oh, that's cool Bro. I understand. Just pay 10,000 and we're good.\n\nMessi: aw sweet! Thanks!\n\nThe next day, messi goes to the company he is investing. Turns out that company is phony and messi never invested in anything. They were just holding messi's money for him while he shows the government his seemingly empty wallet. Messi gets his millions of dollars back while only paying 10,000 in taxes when he should've paid 10 mil.\n\nDid I nail it? \n\n"
###### b"One important thing that I haven't read so far is this ....thousands of companies that actually do this legally. Here's how:\n\n1. Setup a Panamanian company. Many specialized law firms in Western countries will help you do this for about 10k.\n\n2. Have your home company bought out or transfer ownership to the new company.  \n\n3. Operate as you have before. Taxes on income are payable to Panama. Not in say Canada. Think about it? Why would you owe taxes on income earned on a foreign country. From the IRS and CRA perspective all very legal. Morally ambiguious? Yes, but you need to decide if you'd rather pay taxes or keep more money. \n\nMany wealthy Canadians have done this. Former PM Paul Martin runs his business out of Panama. The Mcain  and Irving brothers all offshore. I'm of the opinion that you should point the first get at tax authorities before blaming the individual.\n\nI can expand at length on this topic and how similar process like this work.  But typing on a phone is a pain."
###### b'[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/the-panama-papers-how-the-worlds-rich-and-famous-hide-their-money-offshore?CMP=share_btn_fb) wrote that "though there is nothing unlawful about using offshore companies, the files raise fundamental questions about the ethics of such tax havens \xe2\x80\x93 and the revelations are likely to provoke urgent calls for reforms of a system that critics say is arcane and open to abuse."\n\nIs there really no legal repercussion for the world leaders involved? Isn\'t tax evasion or, in some cases, money laundering a crime? \n\nWhat are some examples of financial transparency that can be applied to this scenario? What can be done, or is already done, to combat tax evasion and money laundering worldwide?\n\nIs this leak tied to any other current events, like the 1MDB case for instance?'
###### b"1) Why wouldn't the anonymous person have leaked it via wikileaks?\n\n2) Are the offshore firms the variable that keeps the economy stable(compounded interest problem)?\n\n3) So this is only the 3rd largest offshore account firm, what possible refuge will account holders and their offshore firm do to cover up their tracks?"
###### b'I\'m going to be real. I\'m not that bright. Every time I hear about articles like this it all goes over my head. I just read "People made money in a way that we don\'t think they should have" and have no idea how it\'s supposed to effect me. And 99% of the time it doesn\'t feel like it does. I never notice anything change.\n\nSo can somebody please explain in layman\'s terms what is going on, why it is bad and what sort of effect it will have that is relevant to a young 18-25 part-time employed male?'
###### b'I animated /u/Jaredlong\'s ELI5 from the original thread: \n\nVideo: [EDIT: video is down for some reason]\n\nGif: http://imgur.com/4OjlNY1\n\nOriginal Comment:\n\n> Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn\'t pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to increase spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can "spend" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\n'

###### b"A question re: media coverage. \n\nWhen this news came out earlier today, all mainstream media companies had it on their front pages, including BBC and Bloomberg. \n\nThe same cannot be said for a similar controversy, the [unaoil leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4cvehu/the_headquarters_of_the_monacobased_oil_company/) a few days ago. \n\nI'm surprised that the unaoil story is still isn't news on mainstream. Why? "
###### b'[The NPR podcast Planet Money did a great story on setting up a shell company a few years back.](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/27/157499893/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven) They have also recently added updates to the story.'
###### b'I\'m not sure if this has been asked yet, but is there "another side" to all of this? A way that the bad guys don\'t look so bad? I\'m just looking for another perspective, even if it\'s a little crazy, so long as it can be fairly solidly backed up.'

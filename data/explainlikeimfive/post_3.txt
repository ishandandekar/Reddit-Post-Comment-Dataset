## ELI5: Stock Market Megathread
#### b"There's a lot going on in the stock market this week and both ELI5 and Reddit in general are inundated with questions about it. This is an opportunity to ask for explanations for concepts related to the stock market. All other questions related to the stock market will be removed and users directed here.\n\nHow does buying and selling stocks work?\n\nWhat is short selling?\n\nWhat is a short squeeze?\n\nWhat is stock manipulation?\n\n[What is a hedge fund?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/l6ptb7/eli5_what_is_a_hedgefund/)\n\nWhat other questions about the stock market do you have?\n\nIn this thread, top-level comments (direct replies to this topic) are allowed to be questions related to these topics as well as explanations.

###### b'Okay let me get this straight \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m Wall Street and I\n\n- borrowed a pillow, have to give it back on the 29\n- sold the pillow for $100 thinking I can buy it back for $50 before the 29\n- reddit bought the pillow I borrowed and now I can only buy it back at $3000\n- tomorrow is the 29 and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have $3000\n- I\xe2\x80\x99m screwed?'
###### b'How does buying and selling stocks work?\n\n.\n\nI own an orange factory. I want to raise money for building a new navel orange machine, so I issue orange stock. I make a special orange that you can buy for $1. I issue 1 million oranges, and raise $1 million. You now own an orange for every $1 you gave me.\n\nThat\'s all you get. If you\'re lucky, I might give you a fraction of how much I make with the new orange machine every year. But you buy the orange share because other people will want it later, when my company is big and successful, and you can try selling the orange share for more than the original dollar.\n\n.\n\nWhat is short selling?\n\n.\n\nYou have 100 of my oranges. I come up to you Monday and say, "If you loan me those 100 oranges, I will give you $2 and your oranges back Friday. You agree, and I go off and sell your oranges for $1 each. I have $100 and owe you $2 and your oranges back. I hope your oranges will be cheaper Friday, and if they are only worth 50 cents, I buy 100 oranges and give you them and $2, and I am $48 richer.\n\n.\n\nWhat is a short squeeze?\n\n.\n\nSomeone saw me make the deal on the oranges, and then immediately sell them. They know I have to have 100 oranges on Friday. So the go buy up all the oranges, and on Friday, when I try to buy oranges, they are standing there with a sign that says "oranges for sale $20." Anyone who wants to sell oranges is selling them there. I have to buy from them for $20 an orange. Now I have lost $1900 dollars buying the oranges back, and still owe the $2. \n\n.\n\nWhat is stock manipulation?\n\n.\n\nWhen I buy the 100 oranges, I go around and talk about how bad oranges are. I tell my friends not to let anyone buy oranges so demand drops. I go on CNBC and talk about how I bit into a nasty orange and threw up. Now oranges are 25 cents. How wonderful... I can buy my 100 oranges for $25, and now my profits are $73!'
###### b'Hopefully this is helpful. I work in the stock market and my little brother asked me to explain what was going on. Here was my response: \n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s say GameStop has 100 shares outstanding currently trading @ $20 per share (so if you own 1 share, you own 1%, 25 shares = 25% and so on) \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. There are only 100 shares of GameStop. Throughout the day people are constantly buying and selling these shares for one reason or another (that\xe2\x80\x99s why the stock price moves up and down constantly)\n\nNow, typically when you think about making money in the stock market you typically think \xe2\x80\x9cbuy low, sell high\xe2\x80\x9d \xf0\x9f\x93\x88. In other words, buying Amazon when it was cheap, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s worth \xf0\x9f\x92\xb0 \xf0\x9f\x92\xb0 \xf0\x9f\x92\xb0. In this case you would be speculating that the stock price of Amazon will go up \xe2\xac\x86\xef\xb8\x8f in the future\n\n- *fun industry term: you are  \xe2\x80\x9cbull-ish\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nHere is where the short selling comes into play. \n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend You have a hedge fund. Alec\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund manager looks at GME (GameStop) and says \xe2\x80\x9cI think GME is over valued, it really should only be trading at $15 per share, not $20 \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94 \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nIn this situation, He is speculating that in the near future, the GME stock price will go down (to $15). \n\n- *another fun industry term; he would be \xe2\x80\x9cbear-ish\xe2\x80\x9d on GME*\n\nNow since the hedge fund manager thinks GME\xe2\x80\x99s stock price will go down, He is going to try to make money on that guess by short selling (shorting) the stock. \n\nTo short the stock The manager is going to *borrow* some shares from someone else, bob, and sell them at the current market price (which is $20). \n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s say he borrows 10 shares (total of only 100 remember) and sells them at the New York stock exchange for $20. He made $200 ($20 x 10 shares)\n\nA while later, GMEs stock price suddenly dips (fun industry term: \xe2\x80\x9cdown ticks\xe2\x80\x9d). It is now trading at $15. \n\nAlec\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund manager was right! now don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, we borrowed the shares from somebody else so we have to give those back. Alec\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund manager goes to the New York stock exchange and buys 10 shares @ $15 and returns those to the lender. \n\nAlec\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund made $50 on that trade total (this is called \xe2\x80\x9cPnL\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nSo the full life cycle: \n\n- *Borrowed 10 shares from \xe2\x80\x9cbob\xe2\x80\x9d*\n- *Sold 10 @ $20 in the market* \n- *Bought 10 @ $15 in the market*\n- *Returned 10 shares to \xe2\x80\x9cbob\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\nTotal profit = (10 x $20) - (10 x $15) \n\n\nOkay.... so now onto what is actually happening with GameStop. \n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s keep the example the same. GameStop has 100 total shares outstanding. \n\nNow a bunch of hedge fund managers all think the exact thing that Alec\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund manager thought  so they all short the stock with the expectation that the price will \xe2\x80\x9cdowntick\xe2\x80\x9d in the future. \n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.... someone on Reddit pointed out that despite the fact that GameStop only has 100 shares available at any given time, there were actually 125 shares on loan to cover short sales. \n\nI know this part is confusing, which it should be. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense mathematically. How can you have more shares loaned out than available? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to gloss over those details and just say that it is possible, and does happen on occasion. \n\nNow when you have a stock that is over shorted like this, you have one major risk, which is called a \xe2\x80\x9cgamma/short squeeze\xe2\x80\x9d . It does not occur often. \n\nIn a gamma/short squeeze, there are more shares loaned out than available. That is because all of those hedge fund managers thought the price would go down and got greedy and tried to make as much \xf0\x9f\x92\xb0 as possible and over borrowed assuming they would be able to cover it. But, someone pointed that out on Reddit, and was able to get that information to go viral. Now with all of these new people buying the stock, it forced the stock price up, very quickly (supply and demand). \n\nJust like in the example, these hedge fund managers had to return the shares to the lender... the problem is, the stock price has gone up so much that if they have to \xe2\x80\x9cclose their position\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99ll lose a fortune. \n\n- *Example: I sold 10 @ $20 = $200*\n\nInstead of going down; the stock price went up to $400. I have to return the stock to the lender and the only way to do it is to go buy it back. So: \n\n- *I buy 10 @ $400 = $4,000*\n\n- *PnL = +$200 - $4,000*\n\ninstead of making money; I lost $3,800. \n\nThis is basically what is happening with GME on a much bigger scale\n\nEdit 1: \n\nLots of people asking about the \xe2\x80\x9cloan\xe2\x80\x9d. It\xe2\x80\x99s not really a loan in the way that you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking. When you execute an order to sell a share, you are required to Mark it as either \xe2\x80\x9clong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cshort\xe2\x80\x9d. What this really means is, do you \xe2\x80\x9chave\xe2\x80\x9d the stock right now in your bank account, or are you \xe2\x80\x9cable\xe2\x80\x9d to get it easily. So theoretically, everyone could be marking their orders as short sales, assuming the shares are easy to borrow and readily available, except, as the price goes up, people panic and start buying them all up and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough to go around. This in turn drives the price up further. Hence the \xe2\x80\x9csqueeeeeeeze\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTypical settlement of a trade occurs t+2. In other words, you\xe2\x80\x99re required to deliver the shares you sold short to the counter party within two business days of execution\n\n\nEdit 2:  \n\nfor those asking about option expiration: \n\n\nAn option as like a coupon. It gives the coupon holder the right to buy or sell stock, at a given price, on a given date. \n\nThink about it this way. If I think that the stock price of GME is going to go up in the near future, I can buy a coupon (technically a call option) that gives me the right to purchase the stock for a set price at a later date. So if GME is @ $20, I may buy a call option that gives me the right to buy GME stock for $20 per share exactly one month from now (expiration). The idea is that within that time frame; the gme stock price will increase, thereby making my coupon valuable because it allows the owner to buy at a discount. \n\nOn the other side, you have someone who \xe2\x80\x9cwrites\xe2\x80\x9d the contract. Essentially sells you the coupon. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say GameStop is trading at $20, and you buy that $20 coupon. Well now, GameStop is trading at $400. So if your expiration is tomorrow you can \xe2\x80\x9cexercise\xe2\x80\x9d it, and the writer is required to deliver your shares for the agreed upon price, $20. To do that, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have to go out and buy it at these exorbitant prices'
###### b'What will happen if the Melvin hedge fund cannot buy back the GME shares?\n\nCan they file for bankruptcy, as an organization? Or should each individual associated with the fund do that?\n\nIf they declare bankruptcy, what will happen with all the shareholders who lent them their shares? Will they lose them forever?'

###### b"Melvin is in 5th grade.\n\nHe goes to a school where kids sell different kinds of candy to each other on the playground.\n\nMelvin is friends with an older, bigger kid named Essie-C. He makes sure that all the candy sales on the playground happen fairly. If a kid doesn't pay for the right price for the candy, or if the kid selling the candy just takes the money, Essie-C beats them up. Teachers at the school let this all happen because the kids like candy, they are better behaved when they have it, and Essie-C is generally a pretty trustworthy kid who is feared by the bad kids.\n\nA delicious new candy called Chee'umee has come out, but it's only available in Japan. It's the perfect candy in every way, EXCEPT that many of the batches spoil very easily. The candy is so good though, that people still buy it, even with the possibility that they might end up with spoiled batch. Normally the wrapper of the candy is bright metallic green, but when it spoils, it turns black.\n\nMelvin is friends with Essie-C. One day, Melvin has an idea and pulls Essie-C aside.\n\nMelvin: Hey Essie-C! Have you heard about this new Japanese candy called Chee'umee?\n\nEssie-C: Nope.\n\nMelvin: Well, it's really good and I want to sell it to the kids on the playground, but I don't have any with me. My dad is going on a business trip to Japan next month, and he can bring some back for me. Would it be cool if I sell the other kids IOUs? Then when I get the candy, They can exchange their IOUs for the candy!\n\nEssie-C: OK\n\nMelvin: Well, there's one more thing. The Chee'umee might spoil before the kids get to exchange the IOUs for it. If that happens, is it okay if I keep the money they paid for the IOU? The kids I'm selling to will need to understand that we might get a spoiled batch and their IOUs won't be worth anything.\n\nEssie-C: Sure. But you'd still have to give them the spoiled candy, if they want it.\n\nMelvin: No kid would want the spoiled candy!\n\nEssie-C: Them's the rules.\n\nMelvin: Fine...\n\nOn the playground, Melvin follows this plan and sells 140 IOUs, which are little slips of paper to all the kids on the playground. He makes a lot of money that day.\n\nLater that evening, Melvin talks to his dad, Sid Atell, at dinner. Melvin: Dad, when you go to Japan, do you think you could bring back some of that Chee'umee candy?\n\nSid: Sure, son! How much do you need?\n\nMelvin: Well, I was hoping for... 140 pieces?\n\nSid: Goodness, son! That's a lot! I don't think I can bring that much back. I can bring back, oh about 20 pieces. Would that be okay?\n\nMelvin: Sure I guess. Here's the money for the 20 pieces.\n\nMelvin figures he will just tell the 120 kids that their candy got spoiled on the trip back from Japan. But this is great for Melvin, because he only had to pay his dad for 20 pieces of Chee'umee!\n\nA month later, his dad returns from his trip to Japan with 20 pieces of candy, and all but 5 turned black. Melvin takes all the candy to the playground and exchanges all 5 of the shiny green metallic candies for IOUs. The 5 kids who got the green candies are excited and the candy is as delicious as advertised. The other kids are quite annoyed that so much of the candy spoiled. \n\n3 kids, Wally, Sam and Betty, are a little suspicious of Melvin, so they ask for their candies anyway. Melvin hands it over.\n\nWally, Sam and Betty open the candy and eat it. To their amazement, the candy is just as good! Better, even! The wrapper just turned black, but the candy itself is just fine! Wally, Sam and Betty tell all the kids on the playground to use their IOUs and get the candy even if it's in a black wrapper.\n\nMelvin is now in a tough spot. He goes to Essie-C for help, but Essie-C reminds him of the deal. All IOUs have to be exchanged, if the kid wants their black-wrapped candy.\n\nAs a last ditch effort, Melvin goes to the playground teacher, Mrs. Robin Hood to tell her of his predicament. All these kids have IOUs and they really want the candy, but he can't give it to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Holy cow thanks everybody for the awards.\n\nCleaned up some grammar."
###### b"What happens if you fail to return the borrowed stocks? Like you sold the borrowed stocks but everyone else bought it and now there are no stocks to purchase. What then?\n\nAlso how do you *borrow* stocks? If you sold it then doesn't the stock's ownership change?"

###### b"Lets start with a baseline: there is a city, and in that city people are **trading apples**.\n\n\n>How does buying and selling stocks work?\n\nIf you want to buy an apple, you can walk up to a shop (a middle man, a broker) and ask them to buy an apple. The shop owner then gets apples from the farm or from someone else and sells them to you at the price that is agreed upon. If you want to sell an apple, you can set a price or agree to a price that the shop owner wants to buy your apples at.\n\nIf more people want apples, the price goes up, as there is more demand and fewer apples. The sellers can ask more money.\nIf less people want apples, the price goes down because they might be stinky apples no one wants.\n\n>What is short selling?\n\nYou have an apple. Its worth $10 in your city. I walk up to you, and I tell you, let me borrow your apple. I will pay 1$ to lend it for every week I have it. You agree. \nAs soon as I get it, I sell it for $10. I now have money and no apples. One week later, the price of apples goes down to $5. I buy an apple at $5 and give you your apple back. I've made $4 profit (since I paid $1 to borrow it). I have shorted apples. I have made money on the price of apples going down.\n\nIf the price went up instead, and I was wrong, I lose money when I have to buy the apple back to give back to you.\n\n>What is a short squeeze?\n\nIf tons of people in my city are shorting apples, but the price actually goes up (I was wrong) they are in trouble! The price could technically keep rising and their risk is infinite.\nNow if demand goes up, and people suddenly LOVE apples, those people that shorted get really really nervous. The higher it goes, the more it costs to buy back the apple (cover). \nWhen the first person that shorts breaks, and buys back apples, the demand raises, and the prices goes even higher!\nNow suddenly shorters are racing for who can buy back first, making the price explode like a bomb.\n\n\n>What is stock manipulation?\n\nPeople doing funky things with apples to wrongly give the illusion the apples are worth less. For example, they can lend out apples that they just borrowed from someone else, or say that there is a worm infestation when really there is not. Or they can close apple shops altogether, which would be really bad and illegal.\n\n>What is a hedge fund?\n\nIts like an apple king in your city, they have a lot of apples and/or move a lot of apples, making a lot of money in doing so. They have a lot of power to influence the price of apples to their benefit."
###### b'>How does buying and selling stocks work?\n\nBuying and selling stocks is quite simple. A stock in a company has a certain price. The more people who buy that stock, the value of the stock goes up. Demand is increased, so price goes up. Conversely, if a lot of people sell a certain stock, the price goes down.\n\n>What is short selling?\n\nShort selling is what you can do if you think the value of a stock is going to decrease. Here\'s how it works. Let\'s say you think stock XYZ is going to decrease in price within one month. You, through your broker, can short sell it. When you short sell, you "borrow" a certain number of stocks from someone who holds them. Let\'s say you borrow 100 shares of XYZ at $100 per share with a total value of $10,000. Once you borrow them, you sell them at $100 per share for $10,000. If a month later the price of XYZ goes down, let\'s say to $50 per share, all you need to do is buy 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share for $5000 and give it back to the person you borrowed from (minus a small principle). You get to keep the difference between the price you sold it for ($10,000) and the price you bought it for ($5000), which is $5000.\n\nHowever, if the price of the stock does not decrease, you are still required to return the same number of shares you borrowed. Let\'s say XYZ doesn\'t decrease in value but jumps from $100 per share to $150 per share. By the end of the month, you are required to buy 100 XYZ shares for $15,000 in order to return them (minus the principle you owe). You have now lost $5000 in your short sale because the stock increased in value.\n\n>What is a short squeeze?\n\nA short squeeze is when the price of a stock is driven up (by purchasing the stock) in order to cause people who short sold the stock to lose money. The most popular short squeeze at this moment is GameStop or GME. A bunch of hedge fund managers short sold GME, which was trading at ~$20 per share at the beginning of the year, anticipating that it would drop in value. People at r/WallStreetBets saw this and decided to coordinate to buy GME and drive the price up. Currently, GME is trading for $350 per share. That means people who shorted GME at $20 per share, must now pay 17.5x what they borrowed in order to return the shares to whomever they borrowed them from.\n\n>What is stock manipulation?\n\nBy definition, "Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain." You could argue that what r/WSB has done is market manipulation, as they have driven up the price of a stock (GME) that has nothing to do with the value of the company or any natural market forces. Conversely, you could also argue that what Robin Hood did when they banned users from purchasing GME was market manipulation, as they took actions that affected the price of a stock regardless of what the market was indicating.\n\n>What is a hedge fund\n\nA [hedge fund](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102113/what-are-hedge-funds.asp) is "a limited partnership of investors that uses high risk methods, such as investing with borrowed money, in hopes of realizing large capital gains." It\'s basically a bunch of investors using money that is not theirs in order to make money in the stock market." It\'s basically a bunch of people getting together, pooling their money and telling a fund manager, "You can trade with this money we\'ve pooled together to either go long if you think the market will rise or short if you think the market will go down."'

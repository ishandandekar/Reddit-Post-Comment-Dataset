## ELI5: Why can people walk many miles without discomfort, but when they stand for more than 15 minutes or so, they get uncomfortable?
#### b''

###### b"Your leg veins have [one way valves](http://www.merckmanuals.com/~/media/manual/home/images/cvs_one_way_valves_veins.gif?la=en&thn=0) in them. They work when the [skeletal muscles around them contract and release.](http://www.theveincenterar.com/images/Picture4.jpg)\n\nWhen you are walking around, the flexion/relaxation of the walking muscles are literally pumping the blood back to your torso.  When you are standing still, you aren't getting that pumping action naturally.  You *could* flex/release your legs intentionally, while standing, but it's not nearly as effective as walking is.\n\nHope that makes sense!"
###### b'I work at a vein surgeon\'s office. I actually asked him this.\n\nBasically, when you are standing, blood flow slows and "pools" in your legs due to gravity. But when you walk, your muscles contract and push the blood in your veins and vessels back up into your upper body. \n\nOn the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements  to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.  \n\nEdit: As others have suggested, not locking your knees is also key\n\nEdit 2: As others have mentioned, micro movements could be flexing your calves, distributing weight back and forth between your heels and toes, wiggling your toes, etc. \n\nEdit 3: If you have persistent leg problems even without prolonged standing and even after conservative measures (compression stockings, exercise, etc.), I would recommend getting a referral to a vein specialist from your PCP (in the US) to get it properly treated. You may just have bad veins. \n\nWhoa! My very first gold. Thank you stranger \xf0\x9f\x98\x9d'
###### b'When you stand, the same muscles in your feet fire repeatedly as the pressure on them remains constant. However, when you walk about, the pressure shifts to and from different areas of your foot as the same muscles aren\xe2\x80\x99t working all the time. If you have a sore area on your foot, walking will be less painful than standing as the pressure is on the area for less time'
###### b'A lot of the answers on here are focused on blood flow which is great but it misses a big part of it. Your joints are lubricated by their joint fluid (synovial fluid). The way the get new fluid and nutrients is through movement. When you stand still the fluid is not refreshed and it tends to dry out in a sense. This makes joints painful and causes that stiff feeling when you try to start moving again. Shortly after moving the fluid and nutrients are replenished and things move again.\n\nCirculation is a big part but joint movement is what provides the fluid flow. If you kept your joints still and contracted the muscles to get blood flowing you would still feel the majority of stiffness and aches.'
###### b'Walking increases blood flow. Standing causes it to pool in your legs. More blood flow means more oxygen to the muscles and more efficient removal of edit: lactic acid buildup. Standing also means keeping your muscles rigid, which is much more stressful on them than simply moving, where periods of contraction and release have points where less energy is being used. If you want an example, try doing slow curls vs fast curls. Your muscles will fatigue faster from slow tension than quick tension.\n\nedit: This really applies to any muscle groups used in moving around.'
###### b"Surgeon here. It all has to do with physiologic load. We are not anatomically designed to accommodate static (standing in one position) loads for an extended period of time. None of our load-bearing tissues (primarily bone) have rigid viscoelastic properties sufficient to withstand static stress (bone is actually a relatively soft material compared to metal etc). Walking,or even shifting weight while standing, will redistribute our body's load on the weight bearing tissues in our legs and allows those tissues to 'recover' during the phase when the body position changes."
###### b"As someone with POTS I know the reason for this on a very personal level. I've failed two tilt table tests because walls of my arteries don't produce enough force to keep an adequate amount of blood pumping up to my brain resulting in dizziness and blurred vision upon standing upright. When I get up I immediately have to start walking so my calf muscles push on the arteries in my legs to produce the force needed. Sometimes I have to flex my calf muscles before standing up to prevent my blood from pooling in my legs. I also wear compression socks to prevent venous pooling. I cannot work jobs that require me to be on my feet in a stationary spot because I get insane amounts of fatigue and lightheadedness. I also have to use a shower chair to  wash myself. I have to sit in a chair to cook. Standing is so unbearable that I dread getting up out of bed every morning. I have to get up in increments so my body can adjust to the change in posture. "
###### b"Also your mind is more active as you walk so it's focused less on discomfort. Different hormones are released too and this also affects the way your brain is working in response to discomfort. So me boxers continue fighting with a broken hand. Some runners with sprains and maybe fractures. Sometimes people who just work hard forget to eat. "

###### b"Blood in your body is pumped by the heart. This moves it out, away from your heart. The blood vessels that lead away from your heart have valves that keep the blood from flowing backwards. As blood reaches the farthest part of your body it is separated into many tiny tubes that supply all the parts of your body. This causes the blood to slow down A LOT. \n\nWhen blood goes to return to the heart there are valves in the in those blood vessels which help to prevent blood from flowing backwards. Also, because it has now slowed down it does not move back to the heart very easily, the forward pressure is much lower than in your arteries. This allows gravity to overcome them and allow blood to flow backwards (this is less common in a healthy person). The tubes in your legs that send blood back to the heart are surrounded by your leg muscles. When you walk they are squeezed and this pushes the blood back to your heart. Without the extra pressure from your leg muscles pumping it can be difficult to overcome the force of gravity pulling downwards on the blood. \n\nWhen you stand those muscles aren't pushing the blood so it becomes harder to move it. This means that the old, used up blood, is stuck in the lowest point of your body. This is your feet. Because the blood is used up it has no oxygen to keep the muscles in your feet healthy. \n\nWhen your body senses there is not enough oxygen it sends signals to your brain that trick it into thinking there is pain. This causes you to try and move the part of the body that is in pain which ideally allows fresh blood to flow in with new oxygen. This is also why it feels like your chest burns when you hold your breath. "
###### b'[Circulation.](http://www.jobst.com/mainnavigation/leg-health/veins-valves.html) When you walk the flexing of your calf muscles help push the blood up your legs back to your heart. A failure of these valves can cause varicose veins.'
###### b'Nerves in the soles of your feet that are stimulated by pressure when you stand up send signals "upstream". These signals cause the activation of a number of muscles throughout your body, not just in your legs, to help maintain your posture. \n\nNerves can emit a limit amount of neurotransmitter to broadcast their signal before they need to "reload." If you activate these nerves too long - for example by standing still for a few minutes without varying the pressure on your soles - you\'ll deplete the neurotransmitter, the signals to your posture muscles will start to fail, and you\'ll feel fatigued and start to wobble.\n\nSource: I did research at NASA in the 90s about this. We were trying to help figure out how to minimize atrophy on astronauts on long trips in microgravity. One discovery is that all of their posture muscles atrophied, but applying constant pressure to their soles (e.g., wrapping their feet tightly) wasn\'t an effective solution.\n\nFor more reading, check the variable foot pressure research done by Prof. Chuck Layne at the University of Houston.'
###### b'Just an aside: this * \\* points to the rest of the thread\\* * is why, in any civilized jurisdiction, workplace-safety regulations consider standing in a single place for long periods to be a hazardous condition, and require it to be mitigated by things like fatigue mats and regular breaks.'
###### b'I think it has something to do with your body being built to be in motion. Osteokinematically you are good at walking and running for hunting. We are built for the "hunt" but we aren\'t made very well for just having a lot of loading in a stationary position. \n\nSo imagine our skeleton is a bunch of levers and our muscles are just the ropes making it move. It is easy for your body to keep that up as it isn\'t too strenuous with the loading and unloading of joints. However standing in one position you have all your weight on those same joints in your pelvis and spine. This constant compression is uncomfortable and isn\'t what your body is optimised for. '
###### b"Follow-up question here. When I feel physical fatigue from standing it's in my lower back. However from walking it's likely in my legs.\n\nIs this because of my stance/posture or more related to the fact that one is dynamic and the other is not? I'm seeing a lot of unsourced suggestions in this topic (even though it is ELI5) and I'm doubting the accuracy."

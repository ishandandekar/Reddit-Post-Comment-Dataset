## TIFU / My (20F) girlfriend of two years told me the music that I (25M) play during sex is weird and a major turn off
#### b'\nA little back story; when I first started having sex I researched into ways to be better as I was a little stiff and pretty much had no idea what I was doing. I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.\n\nI searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.\n\nThere are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she\xe2\x80\x99d like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit annoyed. \n\nI pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. \n\nNot to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just her?\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  \n\nI thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. \n\n[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)\n\nTL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me for over two years making sex now awkward.'

###### b"no way can someone be this clueless. \n\nno way. I refuse to believe it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, you shouldn't be playing the same song every time you bang...\n\n second, it should never be this song...\n\nit's absurd that this was even thought of, joke or not."
###### b'Id be too busy laughing my ass off if this song came on in the moment.'
###### b'Omg it gets worse the longer you listen. I am CRYING with laughter. Thanks OP.'
###### b"I listened to that song and literally have tears in my eyes from cracking up. Thank you for making my day, and my sympathies dude for the absolute roasting you are getting and will continue to get in this comments section.\n\nAs to why she didn't say anything, I can only assume she was hoping you would get tired of the song eventually or change up your playlist, so that she wouldn't have to tell you herself and make things awkward. Agree that 2 years is a long time."
###### b'As soon as I saw the thumbnail of the album cover, I thought: please God DONT let it be Cbat...'
###### b"This must be a GodTier Shitpost lol. \nI admire your gf's commitment and willpower I cannot stop laughing at mere thought of someone fucking to that song and rythm."
###### b"This man's literally fucked his girl to robot dolphin sounds."
###### b'This sounds like an inflatable clown toy falling down the stairs.'
###### b"\\> The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry but this part made me lose it, this has to be a joke"
###### b"My guy. My man. My friend. That song sounds like a mouse caught in the talon of an owl slowly dying. At least the intro does. I couldn't make it much further. It's really bad. I'm so sorry"
###### b"This is the song that plays when the psycho clown at a haunted carnival is stalking you.\n\nIt's like straight up serial killer music."
###### b"Im sitting on the toilet laughing uncontrollably to the comments in this thread.\n\nIf this was a serious post, OP, you should rethink your approach to sexual relations. It's not about the rhythm, it's about communicating with your partner."
###### b'Without the song playing she can still tell that he\xe2\x80\x99s thrusting to a specific song\xe2\x80\x99s tempo \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3\nI\xe2\x80\x99m dead\n\nEdit: listened to the song in question. OF COURSE she can tell you\xe2\x80\x99re thrusting to THAT song. It\xe2\x80\x99s got the most awkward staccato rhythm I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.'
###### b"I tried it on my wife for the sake of science and she asked if I'd acquired a head injury. We are 0 for 2 on this one bud."
###### b'Post the whole playlist you coward. I wanna see just how bad it is.'

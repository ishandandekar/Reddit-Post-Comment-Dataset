## TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.
#### b'The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. \n\n6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  \n\nThe fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. \n\n\nSo since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It\xe2\x80\x99s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. \n\nAfter 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. \n\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I\xe2\x80\x99m turning the light on I realize:\n\nThe goddamn thing is dimmable. \n\n\nFor 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to \xe2\x80\x9cdim\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nFuck me. \n\nTL;DR\n\nFor 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time.

###### b'I sat at my dining room table under a very dim fan light that I could have sworn used to be brighter a year ago reading your post. I got up and hunted down the fan remote stuck forgotten in a drawer and replaced the batteries. There was not obvious slider for a dimmer but I just held the light button down and what do you know the light got a lot brighter! It is fair to say that your post has brightened my life. Thanks'
###### b"True story, I installed a food disposal years ago and forgot to knock out a plastic piece to hook to the water line. The first time the dishwasher ran after that  it didn't drain. I thought the dishwasher went bad too and didn't replace it for a year and washed dishes by hand. When I bought a new dishwasher and went to hook it up to the water line I discovered my mistake. I never told my wife what the real problem was. LOL"
###### b"Lmao that title sounded way more ominous than the actual fuck up. I'm glad it's not a darker story"
###### b'Long term troll, your wife knew about it and was waiting for you to finally try to fix it.'
###### b"Glad I didn't wait 6 years to figure that one out when we bought a house,  It only took my 5 year old 2 months to tell us what the problem was. "
###### b"I'm gonna be honest.... I totally thought this would end in you finding a huge spider's web or rat's nest or a mass of cockroaches or something when you changed your light. I'm glad it wasn't. Your result was a lot more wholesome. \n"
###### b'And on the 6th year God said let this dumb dumb have light.\n\nLol glad you figured it out OP'
###### b'Something else might have been set to dim too. '
###### b'The rare TIFU that hit me to the core.\n\nMinor. Life-changing. Completely preventable.\n\n*swirls wine glass, sniffing*\n\nAn *excellent* vintage.'
###### b"OMG u/moby323 thank you.  We moved into a new house several months ago. The ceiling fan light in my office works but wasn't bright enough. I've just been ignoring it.  Your post inspired me to see if it was dimmed.  It was in fact dimmed. Much better now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: many people have asked, so I will explain that the remote control has two buttons for the light. I assumed one would brighten and one would dim. But they both toggle. Odd, but I ignored it. Turns out if you hold the button it changes brightness.  From the replies, it seems that standard behavior is a single light button that cycles through brightness.  This one, the button you choose determines the direction it starts in when cycling brightness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, thank you for the gilding, kind strangers.  Did y'all know that gold comes with a week of Premium? I didn't. That's pretty kickass. Also 100 Coins which is enough to give silver. Nice."
###### b"Your night vision ability improved so this isn't a fuck up."
###### b'The part I love most is that it\'s been six years. Like a month would get a slight chuckle, a year would see me expel air from my nose, but six years!? I was 14 six years ago, I was in grade 9 and didn\'t even have a job. That is how long you have just accepted this misfortune of having no overhead bedroom light only to find out it\'s dimmable. What was your reaction? I\'d expect at this point it wouldn\'t even be one of anger, just a defeated, quiet "you\'ve got to be kidding me"'
###### b'Reminds me of this golden tifu:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3xtp2w/tifu_by_realizing_that_i_hadnt_even_seen_my/'
###### b"This merits a slow clap.\n\nBut hey, you did figure it out in the end.\n\nIt's a bright\\* outcome!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*sorry for the pun, couldn't resist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Oh wow!, my first silver and my karma doubled in 2 hours. Thank you people!\n\nEdit 2: Doh! That's not silver... Thanks for the platinum !"
###### b'You did end up replacing it, right? Cause no way I would have admitted to my wife that we just had it on dim for 6 years :)'

## TIFU: I have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and I 100% deserve it...
#### b'This is his now ex-wife.\n\nDid he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve removed all of this personal story for my family\xe2\x80\x99s protection and changed this account\xe2\x80\x99s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.\n\nI took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.\n\nI came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.\n\nReason we slept in the living-room is because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cfun camping\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpicnic\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThis morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.\n\nI went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.\n\nOh, and if you can read this, I\xe2\x80\x99ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.\n\nTL;DR: His life is ruined.'

###### b'**FULL WITH ALL UPDATES**\n\n**This happened an hour ago, and I\xe2\x80\x99m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s 2 \xe2\x80\x9csituations\xe2\x80\x9d that leads to the conclusion of the FU.\n\nFirst situation:\n\nAsked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to.\n\nFound out the memory card still had content.\n\nHer husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 \xe2\x80\x9cporn\xe2\x80\x9d video, assuming sent to him a while back.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.\n\nA certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.\n\nSo finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always fantasized about, \xe2\x80\x9cgifting my past self\xe2\x80\x9d, while living my happy current life.\n\nSecond accident:\n\nI have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.\n\nWife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it\xe2\x80\x99s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she\xe2\x80\x99s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.\n\nLast night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?\n\nI have the day off today, today was the day I\xe2\x80\x99d do the \xe2\x80\x9cdeed\xe2\x80\x9d. I don\xe2\x80\x99t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience.\n\nThis would have lasted me tops 5 mins.\n\nBut the \xe2\x80\x9cforeplay\xe2\x80\x9d she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.\n\nWife\xe2\x80\x99s phone didn\xe2\x80\x99t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.\n\nShe comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.\n\nShe knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.\n\nBut VR porn was never \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussed\xe2\x80\x9d as an \xe2\x80\x9cis it cheating if....\xe2\x80\x9d thing. You know the convo I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, \xe2\x80\x9cis it cheating if you have a sex doll\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cis it cheating if it\xe2\x80\x99s a robot\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time\xe2\x80\x9d, etc...\n\nIt was the type of convo we\xe2\x80\x99d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let\xe2\x80\x99s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.\n\nAnyways, VR wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d for me to do so. I guess it was \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That\xe2\x80\x99s when I see her in the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fuck??\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\nThen she looks inside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that my sister?!?!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m fucked.\n\nShe still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.\n\nSeeing from the tracking app... she\xe2\x80\x99s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m fucked.\n\n**UPDATE**: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that\xe2\x80\x99s when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it\xe2\x80\x99s called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.\n\nI was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.\n\nSo basically... after posting... after feeling a \xe2\x80\x9cbit\xe2\x80\x9d better by \xe2\x80\x9ctelling someone\xe2\x80\x9d and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...\n\nThis went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying \xe2\x80\x9cCall me\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nI left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t help as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t focus once on Detective Pikachu.\n\nI received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....\n\nOn the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me \xe2\x80\x9cfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nArrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....\n\nI get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said \xe2\x80\x9csorry\xe2\x80\x9d but there was nothing to be \xe2\x80\x9csorry\xe2\x80\x9d about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I\xe2\x80\x99m not for confrontations or leading conversations, I\xe2\x80\x99m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say \xe2\x80\x9csorry\xe2\x80\x9d.... but didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\n\nWife then says \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says \xe2\x80\x9cknows what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe says \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t lie, the video\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nI was red flushed I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. My heart was beating so fast.\n\nThen wife said she has deleted the video.\n\nThis is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....\n\nThen sister-in-law speaks... she says \xe2\x80\x9cyou do understand this video wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for you\xe2\x80\x9d, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.\n\nBut then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for her husband neither. He\xe2\x80\x99s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he\xe2\x80\x99s been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.\n\nSister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \xe2\x80\x9cfor now\xe2\x80\x9d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\xe2\x80\x99s found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.\n\nIt was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\xe2\x80\x99s been sleeping more and more at her parents house.\n\nMe obtaining the video didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up more than once. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.\n\nFor tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.\n\nWe will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.\n\nWife seemed ok for now too.\n\nTL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s 360 porn video, got caught in the act by wife, now feeling out of body experience and don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to my life.'

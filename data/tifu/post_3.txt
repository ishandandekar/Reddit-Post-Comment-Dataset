## TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.
#### b"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit \n\nFor the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)\n\nLast month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. \n\nAnyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)\n\nIf you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..\n\nTL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/\n\nEdit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx\n\nEdit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!\n\nPlease dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)\n\nEdit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.\n\nI also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.\n\nI love all of you weirdos <3\n\nEdit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W\n\nStop giving me gold! I appreciate it but give to charity instead! Heres something different we could do <3\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Charity/comments/bbok3m/redditors_lets_do_something_different_for_charity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x"

###### b'This must have happened to my tinder account'
###### b'I wish this was my problem. I thought for a moment maybe, but then i remembered sometimes i get 2 or even 3 whole upvotes.\n\nEdit: Complaining about not getting enough upvotes has become my highest upvoted comment of all time LOL. You guys are awesome.. Thank you <3'

###### b"Anybody else hear that? I thought I heard something, but I'm not sure...   :D"
###### b"In a weird and cruel way, I think i'm about to lose my voice again! Multiple posts have been removed including the /AMA. I cant access any of my emails or see anyones comments. My emails to admin are going unanswered. Goodbye Reddit if this is the end! Remember me on this day for years to come."
###### b'You didn\xe2\x80\x99t fuck up. Reddit did you dirty. \n\nWe must demand reparations'
###### b'Reddit, now with single player.'
###### b'This reminds me of that TIFU where that guy forgot he changed his friend\xe2\x80\x99s FB settings to private and then his friend went into a slight depression cause no one liked his posts for a year'

###### b"I went through some comments just to see the 1... 1....1.....1....1...1... I'm sorry, I lost it and have been laughing so hard. So much optimism, so much mute!\n\nEdit: Seems people started upvoting his stuff since I posted this. But you can see the 1s if you keep going through the pages to get to the archived posts.\nhttps://imgur.com/uko7whW"
###### b'Your comment on your own post in r/yoga has me dying for some reason\n\nEdit: [A link to the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/97vopy/recommended_mats_for_tallheavy/)'
###### b'Welcome back to society.'
###### b"Wow that sucks. There needs to be a way to tell if you're muted because you wasted so much time"
###### b'The difference between you and me is that I\xe2\x80\x99m ignored even without being muted'
###### b'Prediction: You are about to reap major reddit karma for your year of silence.'

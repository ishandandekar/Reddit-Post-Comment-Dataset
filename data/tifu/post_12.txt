## TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.
#### b'Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife\'s parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?\n\nSo the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  \n\n"Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?"\n\n"Yes, yes and yes!"  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like "what is an ounce?" or "how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?"  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro\'s Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.\n\nAnd it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can\'t actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.\n\nWhen we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.\n\n"Dose size: 1/2 cookie," I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. \n\nAnd then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   \n\nAbout 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents\' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that\'s when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say "Diarrhea?"  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.\n\n"You didn\'t eat a whole cookie, did you?" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.\n\n"Of course not." I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.\n\nA few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents\' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don\'t remember how I made it to my seat, and I don\'t remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter\'s face as he asked me if I was doing alright.\n\n"Keep it together, man,"  I say to myself.  But my wife\'s sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.\n\nThe waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. \n\nThe moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  \n\n"You are sweating... from your entire face," she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  \n\nAt this point, my wife\'s mom looks over at me with some concern.  "Are you alright?" she asks kindly.\n\n"Yeah, the food\'s just a bit spicy," I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   \n\nMy wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. \n"Bathroom. Now." she hisses. "Get it together."  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  \n\nNow, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.\n\nBut deep down I know that is absurd:  I\'ve been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I\'ve probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I\'ve probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?\n\nBut the guy at the urinal next to me doesn\'t respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. \n\nAfter finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table "for being gone such a long time" just in case my math was off. \n\nNext, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife\'s father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --\n or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife\'s horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he\'ll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren\'t too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I\'m not sitting there on an empty stomach.\n\nSmart man. \n\nHowever, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  "Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what\'s taking so long?" I suggest helpfully to my wife.\n\n"What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago."\n\nAnd at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  "HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!" she demands.\n\n"Whoa, easy there, Torquemada," I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  "I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don\'t want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now."\n\n"REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW."\n\nI look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.\n\nTL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.\n\n\nEDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.\n\nAs for Part II of the story, there\'s a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife\'s singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves "good-bye" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at "getting handsie" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: "Please don\'t die, we have a mortgage."'

###### b'The visual of OP standing up to have water poured into his glass from a waiter across the restaurant got me... and so did him linking his sweaty face to the spiciness of the bread. Phenomenal read from start to finish!'
###### b'You took 6x the recommended dose of edibles... when you had to go do something 30 minutes later. \n\nOh my god OP. You sweet summer child.'
###### b'Can confirm, from Denver. This happens often to my out of town friends. I always suggest \'laying low\'. \n\nHahaha the part "WTF, Denver" had me thinking "yeah don\'t fuck around, those instructions have been tested over and over". Classic'
###### b'Remember, you can *always* do more drugs, but you can *never* do less drugs'
###### b"Dealing with in-laws while stoned is the wooooorst. \n\nI once ate half of a lemon drop while visiting my wife's uncle in CO. I'm just glad I didn't eat the whole damn thing. He liked to talk, so fortunately it wasn't too odd for me to just stare and nod. \n\nBut hey, now you know. When it says half a cookie, it means half a cookie. "
###### b"One night I was the guy at the table who was way too high. Only problem was I was the waiter. I had eaten brownies right before my shift and got WAY higher than anticipated. I was so stoned that I couldn't talk loud enough for my tables to hear me. They seemed irritated. Every time I looked in the mirror my eyes were a darker shade of red. I was overwhelmed with paranoia and certain I was going to get fired and i just kept getting higher. Rough night."
###### b'Reading stories of people fucked up more than they can handle is my favourite.'
###### b'>And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.\n\nThat\xc2\xb4s when I knew this story was going to be great. Hope your ride went well after dinner. \nGreat read btw :)'
###### b'This is my favorite tifu ever. Thank you, ridiculous man.'
###### b'I know a girl in California who sometimes sends me edibles. Years ago, she sent me this giant rice krispie treat with a total dosage of 80mg of THC. I decided to eat half and see what happens. Almost nothing. I didn\'t feel a damn thing. It actually wasn\'t quite half, probably more like 45%. So, a few days later, I eat the rest. again, damn near nothing happens.  As it turns out, I just can\'t get high off marshmallow based edibles for some reason. They just don\'t work very well on me. But I didn\'t know this then.\n\nShe sends me a 220mg chocolate bar a few weeks after that. I remember thinking that well, if roughly 50mg did almost nothing (I felt a tiny itsy bitsy bit of high) then I should eat the entire chocolate bar and maybe I\'d get a decent high.\n\nOh my, was that a mistake.\n\nAs it turns out, chocolate based edibles are extra effective on me. Even now, when I have years of experience with edibles and decades of experience smoking weed (I started in 1992), 50mg of THC chocolate is usually too much for me. I\'d just eaten 220mg. I remember saying at one point, "I can actually feel myself getting higher every second. It\'s like I\'m riding a weed elevator." After about an two hours, I\'m losing my shit and then I realize something. My kitchen is messy and the police are definitely on their way to arrest me for letting my kitchen get so messy. So I started freaking out and panic cleaning my kitchen. It\'s also 2am. So, imagine an insanely high person desperately cleaning his kitchen at 2am, positive the cops are about to break his door down any second and arrest him.\n\nI eventually realize I have to work the next day and I really need to sleep. My shift started at 9am and it\'s already 2am. I slept for like 5-6 hours and actually woke up feeling completely fine. I don\'t remember the day at work at all, so I assume it was uneventful.'
###### b"Edibles are just bad news for pot newbies.\n\n90% of the problems from legal pot have been with edibles and dosing.\n\nPeople don't realize edibles can take up to an hour to kick in. Dosing is NOT straight forward. And to top it off sometimes a tootsie roll looking thing can be enough weed to ruin your night (Cheeba Chews).\n\nBud tenders should really really be steering people who have never been stoned away from edibles - doesn't help there's no place to legally smoke. Best bet would prob be disposable vape pen you can use in hotel bathroom without too much of a stink."
###### b"The whole time becoming unteathered bit is spot on.  Last batch of cookies I made I overshot the strength, and holy shit that was a strange evening.  Great story man, but you really should have seen that coming.  They don't F*** around with edibles in the legal states"
###### b'I feel your pain man. I once ate 5 edibles before going through security at the airport and had a panic attack on the line to board the plane. Had to leave the line and lay down on the floor because I thought I was dying. Made it to Miami though! '
###### b'This is so funny, man. My favorite parth was : "\'Keep it together, man,\' I say to myself. But my wife\'s sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter." Classic.'
###### b'>"Yeah, the food\'s just a bit spicy," I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is nothing on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.\n\nNope, nope, no. This is the moment I fucking lost it.\n\nI wish I could gild you but I\'m broke. This story is glorious from start to finish, hope you\'re okay now and the parents...tolerate you? '

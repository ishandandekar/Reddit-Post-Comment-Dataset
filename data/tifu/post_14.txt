## TIFU by banging my first cousin.
#### b"So, didn't happen today, but last weekend. Finally getting around to really processing it all and I guess trying to deal with it.\n\nWent out for drinks with my girlfriend and met up with my younger cousin at the bar. We'd all hung out once before and had a great time. My cousin invited a couple of her friends to the bar too; we did some barhopping. I got shitfaced pretty unintentionally (The last bar was, I swear, not putting any mixers in my cocktails, they were straight alcohol). So anyway we're about to leave and my cousin's friends are trying to get her home, because she's shitfaced too. Well, my gf was our DD so we offered to let her stay in our spare room. Everyone was cool with that because who's safer than family, right?\n\nWrong. We get home and (I had to piece together some of this later because I blacked out for most of it) apparently initially everything was cool. My cousin went to the spare room and my gf got her situated. The problems started a little later when I, in my infinite wisdom, decided to walk straight out of my bedroom with my girlfriend in it, and into my cousin's room. I don't particularly remember much except for two details which I guess are not important to the story. Well, okay so one might be. I remember her giving me a *very* enthusiastic BJ, which, as you can imagine, makes a lot of noise. Apparently after a while my gf came out of the room wondering where I was because I just fucking disappeared. She didn't barge into the room or anything, but she heard the noises which is pretty fucking obvious. So at that point, she left. Like, me. She left me, and I don't blame her.\n\nAnyway that means I wake up the next morning, having blacked out, oblivious that my gf was gone already, but I'm fucking naked next to my naked cousin. There's cum all over the bed where her face was, she didn't even sleep with a pillow. There's obviously no hiding this but I'm still half-drunk and I went to try to go sneak back into my room, which I found empty. So yeah.\n\nI haven't heard from my gf all week, and I'm sure we're done, and I don't blame her. All I can hope for now is that this shit doesn't get out to my family, because I would probably implode. No, my cousin and I are not going to start hooking up regularly. It's actually super awkward and she has hardly said a word to me either. Again, I don't blame her.\n\nTL;DR drunkenly slept with my cousin, ruined my relationship, family might hear about it, I'm an idiot."

Or some other military group that will throw you to fight some unknown conflict in the middle of nowhere for several years, teach you a new language, and give you citizenship of another country? That's probably your best option right now."
###### b'"So why did fkditallup and you break up?"\n\nGF "he.... prioritized his family too much "'
###### b'At least it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your sister i guess?'
###### b'She is a savage for not sleeping with a pillow who does that'
###### b'Just start saving up to move far away from anyone who ever knew you'
###### b'Hey u/fkditallup, wait until your cousin calls you to let you know she missed her period.'
###### b'As soon as I saw there was a girlfriend involved, I was really, really hoping this was just gonna be some weird threesome story where you ended up having the feels for your cousin, post-poke. \n\nBut, nope...there is is. You left non-familial poonany and went and covered your first cousin with her second cousins. \n\nYep...that\xe2\x80\x99s FU.'
###### b'Usually in TIFU stories there is some shred of a defence explaining away what happened, but not this time.'

###### b"My cousins fucked in a similar fashion years ago. They were all drunk and thought it would be cool to have four people in the shower (girlfriends and boyfriends). They'd also turned out so the lights in the apartment (I dunno, drink logic?).\n\nThe boyfriend of my female cousin fucked the girlfriend of my male cousin and the two cousins fucked.\n\nHow I know this? They came out with it and joked about it at Pop's wake. Nan was shocked but still laughed."

###### b'Honestly, the inordinately high frequency with which redditors seem to bang close relatives, crap themselves in public, lose things up their body cavities, and leave their bluetooth speakers on is shocking.'
###### b'I feel bad for your gf. Drove you around and helped you while you were drunk and then this happens. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make you feel even worse but this is just a whole new level.'

## TIFU by cumming into a coconut
#### b'EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu\n\n\nThis TIFU didn\'t happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I\'m using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. \n\n-------------------------\n\nAnyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a \'health nut\' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.\n\n\nAnyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can\'t fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. \n\n\nI end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. \n\n--------------------\n\nFor the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It\'s heaven. Now before I continue I\'d best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn\'t really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would "go away in the winter". \n\n\nAbout a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I\'ll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.\n\n\n**Worst mistake I have ever made.**\n\n\nYou see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. \n\n\nI screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. \n\n\n**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**\n\n\nTL;DR Don\'t fuck coconuts.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Jesus this exploded. I\'m glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.\n\nEDIT 2: RIP inbox\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I\'m thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it\'s quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back\n\nEDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit\'s history. Lord save me.'

###### b'Congratulations, /u/coconutthrowaway69! Your post has been selected as the **Fuckup of the Week!**'
###### b'I get that your horny brain made you think that fucking a coconut was a good idea, that\'s not even what surprises me.\n\nBut your brain is supposed to return to normal after you blow your load so why did your normal brain tell you "it\'s fine to leave an open coconut in a warm room with semen and butter in it" and most importantly how were you not disgusted at the idea of fapping by using your several days old semen as lubricant ?!'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'"Health Nut" phase'
###### b'I think my favorite part of the story is the 20 minutes you spent drilling the hole in the coconut. That really show some serious commitment to your goals. 20 minutes prepping a coconut for fornication and at no point do you stop to second guess yourself. Way to stand by your decision. '
###### b'"Huh, this thing smells like it\'s rotting a bit, I guess I should shove my dick in it one last time"\n\nWhat the fuck OP?'
###### b'I was worried that your mum was accidentally gonna use the cumconut whilst cooking and serve it as a meal for dinner.'
###### b'You ever wonder if one of the maggots found its way into your dickhole and you just have like a giant fly slowly growing inside of you?'
###### b'[He was right](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6jhf15/comment/djeloz9)\n\nAlso, OP should have treated the coconut like condoms, use just once or twice '
###### b'"I hear my mother is going to be out for the entire afternoon. Horny me decides it would be the perfect time to fuck a coconut"\n\nBoy I tell ya, if I had a dollar for every time I had that same thought. '
###### b'> My mother at the time\n\nThat phrase felt weird when I first read it, but by the time I was done reading this tifu, it all made sense.'
###### b'Hormones are one hell of a drug.'
###### b'*He put his cock in a coconut, and he fucked it all up*'
###### b'>\nAnyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate\n\nWell there goes your anonymity... '
###### b'Thank god, I thought reddit was starting to lose its wholesome material. '

## TIFU by lying to my wife for 13 years…
#### b'TIFU by lying to my wife for 13 years\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nMy wife hates orange and lime flavored candies. I love them. Well, love the orange, like the lime. \n\nSo, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. \n\nWhat she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. \n\nShortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. \n\nSo I haven\xe2\x80\x99t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I\xe2\x80\x99ve never said a word. I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed eating my little lies. \n\nUntil last night\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nWe had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. \n\nShe turned to me and asked if I\xe2\x80\x99ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. \n\nI was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal\xe2\x80\xa6. She asked how long I\xe2\x80\x99ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been married. \n\nShe quit giving me the gummy bears she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.\n\nEdit: \n\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t eat these every day. A few times a year at most.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t just get the \xe2\x80\x9crejects.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a shared bag. Whenever she grabs a few, she would pick out the orange and green and hand to me. Just like I would give the pineapple to her (bleh). \n\n\nTL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites.'

###### b'Every year, for her birthday, my step-grandmother received a gift of chocolate covered cherries from her husband. When he died and she married my grandfather, he thought it would be so thoughtful to continue the tradition. She took one look at the box, stood up, dumped it in the garbage, and declared "I\'m not spending another 30 years pretending to like those disgusting things." \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
###### b"My Mom didn't know that a local pizza place gave free breadsticks with a large pizza. My Dad had been eating them on the way home with the pizza... for 10 years."
###### b"Lmao this is such a legitimate marriage dispute it's ridiculous.  I've been married since 2010 and my wife wouldn't be thrilled about something like this either."
###### b"She's even eating the orange ones out of spite.\n\nYou're both hilarious.  You've got a great union."
###### b'Wait until she finds out the green skittles are green apple.'
###### b'Eating the orange out of spite is 100% what I would do. That\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious.'
###### b'This is gold. I hope you can both share a laugh on it soon. Might take some time though hahaha'
###### b'Dude I hear about guys that cheat on their wives but what you did.... Only god can save you now'
###### b'This is so wholesome.'
###### b'I honestly just think it\xe2\x80\x99s really cute that you guys eat candy with such frequency over 13 years that this is even an issue.  That\xe2\x80\x99s cute as fuck.  Wish I had someone to give the greens to (I hoard the red and yellows).'
###### b"My husband and I have been together for almost 8 years now. Up until last year, we had shared Oreos a certain way. I don't like the middle but I like the cookie. He said he liked doubles, so we would always twist our cookies apart and swap a piece. Win-win, it was a whole thing, and it turns out he has been making himself eat double stuffed Oreos for years because he ALSO only likes the cookie but he didn't want to deprive me. You did, like, the opposite and it's adorably hilarious. Y'all will be laughing about this not too far down the road."
###### b'The wife here. We even got some Christmas ones that were all green and red for our kids\xe2\x80\x99 stockings and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHey! They didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the green ones lime in these! They should always do that.\xe2\x80\x9d He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. We have two kids and matching tattoos, so I guess we will just have to work through this.'
###### b'Be wary if she ever DOES start giving you gummy bears again.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sugar free version, and you need only look at the Amazon reviews to understand that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t giving you those gummy bears because she forgave you.'
###### b'Told my daughter that the pink starburst are liquorice flavored \xf0\x9f\x98\xb3'
###### b">You're making me do this. I'm not even enjoying these... *glares spitefully as biting off the head of an innocent orange gummy bear*\n\n-OPs wife probably"

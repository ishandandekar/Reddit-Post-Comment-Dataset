## TIFU by owning a Golden Retriever while being Black.
#### b"Sigh. \n\nWork was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. \n\nFood ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. \n\nPertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. \n\nBoth dogs were in the neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the \xe2\x80\x9dvoice\xe2\x80\x9d for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. \n\nPup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling \xe2\x80\x9dRUNAWAY\xe2\x80\x9d and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. \n\nI didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9dIs that your dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMy bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be nice because you brought my food. \n\nBut she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, \xe2\x80\x9dokay weird\xe2\x80\x9d but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking \xe2\x80\x9cokay weird...\xe2\x80\x9d again but didn\xe2\x80\x99t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. \n\nI went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. \n\nUh...ok? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\n\nI go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t notice me. I walk up like I\xe2\x80\x99m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you\xe2\x80\x99ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. \n\nI continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. \n\nIt clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. \n\nNo hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver\xe2\x80\x99s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. \n\nHowever, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. \n\nI splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn\xe2\x80\x99t end worse. \n\nTL; DR\n\nOrdered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t get shot but got cake in the end.\n\nEdit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!\n\nTaking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.\n\nI appreciate the sub this was posting to for restoring it after being removed. I apologize that this topic bent the rules and didn\xe2\x80\x99t think 100% before submitting. This was a way to vent. Thank you for allowing this to be a place of dialogue!\n\nStay classy, everyone!"

###### b'From the reports:\n\n>1: Posts about dogs should include pics of said dog. I want to see the dog. Show me the dog.\n\nShow us the dog, OP\n\nEDIT FROM THE FUTURE: OP never provided dog pics, but they did post [this pic](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/iv8mak/someone_wanted_attention_in_between_games/) about 2 months after this post.'
###### b'You know she was waiting around to watch justice get served and you reverse uno carded her... well done sir'
###### b"So she thought you stole your dog... from your next door neighbor? And it was going to go unnoticed unless she called the cops? She's such a hero!"
###### b'Is there some stereotype that says black people cant own golden retrievers?  I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t get some people'
###### b'What the fuck is wrong with people.'
###### b'**AHEM** Dog tax?'
###### b'Ok seriously, if you WERE going to steal a dog why would you steal your neighbors dog. Like they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice you suddenly had a golden retriever that looked exactly like their golden retriever and seemed to recognize them? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that the most stupid people also tend to be the most racist.'
###### b'Jesus dude, sorry you had to deal with that. Hope the cake was good.'
###### b'Just a heads up, let the neighbor know what happened, and ask them to keep a lookout for Karen.  People like her don\'t like to be told they\'re wrong, and she might try and sneak back to try and "rescue" the dog.'
###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry that happened to you. I own a beautiful golden retriever too and I\xe2\x80\x99m Asian. One time a neighbor in my building told me it was interesting I had a Golden because they\xe2\x80\x99re super \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican\xe2\x80\x9d dogs. I literally grew up in a small town in Texas.'
###### b"Maybe I am a bit paranoid, but I would had followed through with the police and the delivery app all the way to get the person's name and everything. She already have your address and in her mind you stole that dog, I mean, she can try to steal it and you know golden retrievers will go out with just about anyone. Maybe an official complaint with the police might be in order. I'm just paranoid with pets man. Sorry if I give you something else to worry in your already shitty day."
###### b"I'm rollin cause as soon as you said she asked if it was your dog, I knew what was up. \n\nStealing... a golden retriever. Smmfh. Glad you--and your dog--are still here. Also, carrot cake is the shit. It is my opinion that you have good fuckin taste. I hope you have a much better day"
###### b"A) what the everloving fuck?\n\n2) This post requires dog tax\n\nIII) [Here's mine](https://i.imgur.com/2tDhgw1.jpg)"
###### b"The thing about racism is that YOU didn't fuck up. No way it's your fault."
###### b"Hilarious writing, but also a sad sign of the times. You're an awesome pet owner, Lord knows I don't have the energy for a Golden Retriever, and anyone who does is a straight up Saint in my book. Amazing dogs, insane energy.\n\nYou definitely deserve cake after that. The classy (and DILLIGAF) way you handled that makes proud. Hats off, and thanks for the laugh."

## TIFU by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my GF
#### b'Minor background: I am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. I\'m 6\'2 and have a pretty "tough-guy" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends\' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I\'m not gay, I just am me.\n\nSo while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn\'t get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she\'s tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.\n\nI\'m still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she\'s also really taken aback, she won\'t even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I\'m gay. And she\'s really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I\'m not, that if I was I\'d definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she\'s sorry and that she "needs to think about what kind of man" she wants, and then doesn\'t contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she\'s stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn\'t know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I\'m pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I\'m not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she\'s just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.\n\nLater on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.\n\nWe are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.\n\nTl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nShe\'s a nice girl, she\'s just not pickin up what I\'m puttin down. It\'s a silly thing to be mad about.\n\nAnd by popular demand: [It\'s shawl over for you hoes](https://imgur.com/a/XXCrcM5)\n\nEdit 2: [Shawlbro](https://imgur.com/a/ZvlS5N9)'

###### b"It's official. That's the most I've heard/seen the word 'shawl' in a single day."
###### b'2 sayings come to mind here, one from my basic instructor (who was also special forces, so I figure you\'ll like that one) one I picked up... somewhere, I don\'t remember where a long time ago.\n\nWhat my instructor taught me was simple, "If you have something that makes your life easier or more comfortable, like using kneepads, or grabbing an umbrella, or whatever, and you choose not to use it, you are no tougher or better than the man who chooses to. In fact, if it says anything about you, it probably says you\'re stupider, because while you\'re standing there, wet and cold in the rain, he grabbed an umbrella and is dry."\n\nThe other is, "The toughest, most "alpha" thing you can do in any situation is the thing you want, while everyone else is catering to others whims, you are confidently being you with no fucks given what others think."'
###### b'We really need a picture of these awesome shawls!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  OP delivered, picture of the shawl in his original post.  Thanks!  :)'
###### b'If you and Shawlbro continue to sport shawls and get new, hotter girlfriends, you should call it "Shawlshank Redemption".'
###### b'What the fuck?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this shawl talk and no pictures!? They sound pretty close to wild west ponchos, to me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit\\* yay! He added a picture! Great shawls, too. I have.. shawl envy..?'
###### b'"Give your balls a tug you titfucker"\n\n\\-Shawlsy'
###### b"So, where is the reddit tax of you two tough SHAWLBROS in your shawls. \n\nI personally favour a nice neutral neutral coloured thin poncho however ponchobro doesn't roll off the tongue as well.\n\nEdit: VINDICATION!!!!  Shawl tax achieved I shall sink into the shadows."
###### b"'Today my girlfriend fucked up' by giving a ~~shot~~ shit about a shawl'\n\n\nFTFY"
###### b'Shawls before dolls'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"I guess you could say both of those girlfriends were pretty shawllow... I'll see myself out"
###### b"Where's the tifu? I see this as an absolute win. Got a cool shawl, dropped a dummy."
###### b'And seriously, have these girls never seem Israeli/Middle Eastern military?  Bassass shawls abound.'
###### b"Sorry to hear man.  But those are girls you don't wanna be with, they liked the image of you in their heads more than the you in reality.\n\nAlso, dude good on ya being comfortable in your own skin, and also being self aware enough to know how you deviate from cultural norms, but still being okay with that."

# r/tifu
## TIFU by having the username “Soundman1488” for 15+ years of being on the internet and been unknowingly identifying myself as a Nazi.
#### b'I found out here on Reddit that my username that I\xe2\x80\x99ve used 15+ years all over the internet was connected to Nazis because of the 1488. They banned me on r/AskReddit for it.\n\nI posted about it on here and changed my name to r/NazisStoleMyBirthday\n\nr/AskReddit unbanned me.\n\nThis post blew up and got really popular. It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit\n\nThis morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence. This was not me. I have no idea how that happened.\n\nSome of you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe this and I understand that. I would be skeptical myself if I were you. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, I would never say things that, much less think them. My intention was to simply share my story and it blew up way more than I thought it would. Some misguided soul thought it would be good to change the post and mess the whole thing up. I take responsibility for what happens on my account, but this statements were not made by me. Obviously they have upset a lot of people and I wish I could meet each of you face to face to apologize.\n\nThis was not a stunt to try and get karma or awards. Again, some won\xe2\x80\x99t believe that and that\xe2\x80\x99s ok.\n\nIf you care, you can look at my original post on r/Banned to see where I was trying to understand why my name was offensive. You can also look at my post and comment history on this account and my new one to see that this was very clearly not me.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry everyone. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m done with Reddit entirely.'

###### b'Why would Nazi need a soundman though?'
###### b"Just append 'not a nazi' to your username and you'll be good to go."
###### b"$1488 is one of the few numbers that are banned as a wager on Jeopardy, which is how I found out that 1488 was a hate symbol.  I wasn't a contestant (yet!) but a friend was.\n\nThe full list is $69, $666, $14, $88, and $1488."
###### b'In high school, I put some cool red shoe laces in my black military boots.   I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a skinhead, I was a punk.   But after I did that, lots of the racist folks around started wanting to hang out.  \n\nApparently red bootlaces in black boots was a Nazi symbol thing.   \n\nI put the black laces right back in.   Lesson learned.'
###### b"From now on just use 4188 and say you're from another continent."
###### b"I have the exact same problem regarding date of birth. I never put it in my username but it's very, very frustrating that Nazis stole my birthday.\n\nThe kicker? I'm half Jewish."

###### b'I\xe2\x80\x99m living in Colorado and we have 50+ mountains over 14K feet in elevation. They are commonly referred to as fourteeners or 14ers. I was commenting on a sub about online dating and how every guy out here has something about 14ers in their profile and someone thought I was referring to white supremacy. I had no clue at all about the correlation of 14 and white supremacy.'
###### b"TIL subreddits will ban you based on your username. Tbh I don't even pay attention to peoples names, and when I do it's usually something like u/TEAR_MY_ASSHOLE_DADDY posting on r/aww so I figured most of reddit didn't care."
###### b'Thank god the nazis didn\'t pick a more frequently used number.  Like 3.  I don\'t think I could get on with life if I couldn\'t use the number three. \n\n"How many bread rolls today sir". \n\n"Uh.  Two and one"\n\n"What?  You mean three?"\n\n"For the love of God keep your voice down!"'
###### b"This is both hilarious and awfully sad. It's too bad you were born Jan 4, 1988.  It's not a good idea to include identifying information like that in a username though. I wish you luck on your quest for a new alias!"
###### b"I would also suggest that you don't put so much personal information on the internet. Telling people that you only use one username and writing about your exact birth date is identifying information that does not need to be online imo."
###### b'I too was born in 1988 and have countless usernames with 88 at the end, and just found out about the nazi connotations. Fucking nazis ruining everything.'
###### b'Imagine my surprise seeing this pop up in my trending and going \xe2\x80\x9cHey, I recognize that name. I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s who I think it is...\xe2\x80\x9d Hooooly crap, what a rollercoaster of a story! And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s all been sorted out.\n\nCan 100% confirm that username does not check out. This absolute gentleman is definitely not a Nazi. Quite the opposite, and one of the coolest and kindest people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.'

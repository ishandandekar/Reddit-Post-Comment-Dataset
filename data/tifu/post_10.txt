## TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend’s phone NSFW
#### b'So this happened a few days ago and I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She\xe2\x80\x99s perfect for me. We\xe2\x80\x99re perfect for eachother. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.\n\nWe went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. \n\nShe went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you\xe2\x80\x99re back at the start of the photo album. It\xe2\x80\x99s annoying as hell.\n\nBut some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.\n\nThere she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in my life. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched porn - a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a dick like this. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.\n\nI could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.\n\nI closed the pictures and I\xe2\x80\x99ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I\xe2\x80\x99m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.\n\nWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t had sex since. I can\xe2\x80\x99t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.\n\nTL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed\n\nUPDATE: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people assuming that this was a one-night-stand. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. She was with this guy for 3 years.'

###### b'I can show you my tiny ass dick if it makes you feel better, bro.'
###### b'Maybe it was just the perspective. I always thought I had a huge dick, turns out I just have really tiny hands.'
###### b"Hope it wasn't filed under the favorites folder."
###### b'Theres always a bigger fish...'
###### b'I used to own a gym & one of my regulars had broken up with his wife & went off the radar for a year or two. \n\nHe popped back one night for a chat & a catch-up. He said that at one point he\xe2\x80\x99d got a new girlfriend who was a screamer- she shouted & threw herself about & was ridiculously vocal in bed. \n\nHe reckons he\xe2\x80\x99d had sex with her about 3 or 4 times & whenever he was banging her he was the king of the world. \n\n...Until half way through their next performance when she stopped all the histrionics and said something along the lines of, \xe2\x80\x9c I fucking love shagging you- my last boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s cock was too big & it used to hurt me. But yours, yours fits just fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd that was the last time they had sex. \n\nAnd then he told all his mates thinking they would sympathise. Oh how they laughed.'
###### b'The only solution is to seek out this ex boyfriend and have sex with him yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99ll show that girl who means business.'
###### b'I knew this guy who had a huge donkey dong. Like seriously big, he had won competitions (he was in the army and they did that kind of thing). Well one night he got drunk and he confided to me that it was "a f***ing curse". He told me how women he was about to be intimate with would see it and immediately call it off. Or how he wasnt able to have sex that was pleasurable for girlfriends he was in love with, and that roadblock to normal intimacy ruined the relationship. This big, tough, hung like a gas-pump, soldier was in tears telling me this. \n\n\nA giant cock? No siree, not for me. I\'ll stick with my average sized, fits in pretty much any hole, comfortable in my pants, penis \xe2\x9d\xa4'
###### b"I'm sorry man but I'm upvoting solely for that username."

###### b'Damn bro, that\xe2\x80\x99s rough. I feel like once you hit long term relationship status, you sterilize your phone. That shit would probably ruin me.'
###### b'Tbh a dick that big sounds awful.'

###### b"Bi guy here. You prob won't read this as it's too far down, but I think my perspective might give you some comfort: from my experience, guys with big dicks usually have trouble staying in long term relationships. While it's an exciting thing to look at in porn, it's nearly impossible to have sex with a large penis. Oral sex, as you describe it, is impossible. Vaginal sex will hurt immensely, and don't even talk about anal sex. I'm also above average and most men won't even consider anal sex, some women have complained about pain after vaginal sex. And I can understand why. I dated a man who had a 10 inch dick, also very thick, but I didn't find out until 2 months into the relationship. Three months later I had to break the relationship because we could not have any sex. He wasn't a bottom and I couldn't bottom for him. Our only sex was jerking off. I hurt him immensely by breaking up the relationship, and I myself was hurt. I felt like shit finding out all his relationships ended because of his dick size. He must go through every beginning of a relationship thinking that it may end sooner rather than later because people get tired of how difficult it is to simply enjoy sex. Think about it? You got the girl."
###### b"I think your feelings are very valid. It's not just about the dick size. Often times, when you find out that your current SO's ex had better income, better job, bigger dick, bigger boobs, or more, you are bound to compare yourself with him/her.\n\nIf you truly love your girlfriend and wish to continue the relationship, just sit down with her and be honest. Tell her that you accidentally stumbled upon previous photos with her ex. Don't mention anything about the dick size. Just ask her why she kept those photos. And if she says anything along the line of - I forgot to delete them and all she cares about is you, then you should feel confident that she loves you as a person and everything about you. Of course, you will still have a bit of doubt in yourself that you will never be as good as her ex, but there is a reason why she broke up with her ex, right?  \n\n\nEdit : Words"

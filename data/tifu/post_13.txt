###### b'Hello! I have to hijack the sticky spot because my comod appears to have been kidnapped by Onion Lobby shills as you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6suvyd/rtifu_last_weekend/dlfze4w/). /r/OnionHate wont stand for this kidnapping and will work tirelessly to rescue him. Let us take a moment to pray for /u/PicturElements. \n\n\n...\n\n&nbsp;  \n\nAlso remember to visit /r/coconuthate, fuck coconuts\n'

###### b'Too early to explore space, too late to explore Earth, just in time to read about people fucking coconuts'
###### b"There is like 18 moderators in here. It's coconuts."
###### b"Is it surprising that the first dude fucked his coconut for like a week and others couldn't last a day ?"
###### b'This is what 2017 will be known for fucking coconuts.'
###### b'Last weekend we fucked up and this resulted in the great reddit coconutting of 2017.\n\nIt was bad and we feel bad. \n\nu/Llim has been crying all day. Send [kittens](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR8YBsyJ04t59Xr2FW8QWzc2BjnFmAucxoVhdKN_2_W9EbLCp8VRg).'
###### b"Oh my god, I've witnessed Reddit history. The great coco-nutting of 2017. What a time to be alive."
###### b'frist of all how *dare* u mod shitpost\n\nsceond of all how *dare* u sticky ur shitpost\n\n---\n\nEdit: I\'ve been paid $3000 for this, but I\'d like to ~~shill~~ recommend /r/CoconutHate and also show my support for the most wholesome sub on earth: /r/OnionLovers.\n\n---\n\nEdit 2: It appears my comod and "friend" /u/awkwardtheturtle (aka /u/awkwardtheonionlover) has been brainwashed by the anti-onion lobby and in the process unstickied this shitpost and thus bereft the audience of the world class humor of said post. This will not stand. Spread this to CNN, Breitbart, BBC, and iloveonions.blogspot.com. The one true path is onions, and onions only. Fuck cilantro, though. /r/cilantrohate '
###### b"I'm out of the loop, can someone tell me what these coconutting is all about?\n\nEdit: just found it. What the actual fuck\n\n[Edit again - the link to cocconutt [NSFW]](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rr6ay/tifu_by_cumming_into_a_coconut/)"
###### b"I'm proud to say that I was here to witness this. "
###### b"I'm calling it. Next tifu will be someone fucking a coconut during the solar eclipse and somehow creates a cococumonster."
###### b'Inb4 someone deletes the top post of all time by fucking a coconut\n\nReddit would explode'
###### b'I invested my life savings in coconut stock. '
###### b'why do you go green on a post? just post like us mortals'

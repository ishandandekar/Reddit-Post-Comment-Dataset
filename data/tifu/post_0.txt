## TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas
#### b'Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. \n\nAs soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. \n\nFast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. \n\nTL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. \n\nUpdate:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. \n\nUpdate 2: CHRISTMAS ISN\xe2\x80\x99T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!\n\nP.S. Sorry my mom isn\xe2\x80\x99t a whore. No you\xe2\x80\x99re not my daddy. '

###### b'3.1k comments. \n\nMy ex had blood type ab. She told me her dad had blood type O+. I told her that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. \n\nHer mom admitted that her dad wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her dad. \n\nFucked my birthday right up. '

###### b"I had the opposite thing happen. I did 23 & Me and found out that my first cousins, who I'm not close with (they were estranged for a long time from my dad's brother), also had done 23 & Me because it matched us as first cousins.\n\nI told my dad this and he was like wait, it said that Karen is your first cousin? And I was like yeah? And he asked to see it and then he said, I have to call my brother.\n\nTurned out that my uncle has been convinced for decades that his ex-wife had an affair and his youngest daughter, Karen, wasn't really his.\n\nTurns out she has been this whole time."
###### b'My father also used the AncestryDNA kit. He didn\'t find anything unusual in the results, exactly what he thought it would be. But something weird did happen after he checked the box to allow "close matches" to contact him.\n\nWell, soon after he gets contacted by a woman he had never met who lives over a thousand miles away from him, saying that Ancestry told her that the two of them are cousins. Genealogical records show no relation, but she told my Dad that of her three siblings, only one of them had the "expected" ancestry report. Their parents were no longer living, so no one to ask.\n\nAnyway, upon further conversation, my Dad finds out that when this woman was born, she lived in the same city as most of my Dad\'s family. So he asks her to send him a picture, and he swears, "It\'s uncle Louie in a wig!"'
###### b'People who were just banging away in the 80s and 90s didn\xe2\x80\x99t see this one coming. Damn. '
###### b'I work at AncestryDNA. This actually happens all the time.\n\nEdit: Wow! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect this much attention! I will gladly do an AMA here soon, as I finish out the holidays. Merry Christmas!'
###### b'This actually just happened to some non-direct relatives of mine, essentially my uncles in-laws. \n\nHis brother in law and the wife have three kids who all did 23AndMe, and found out the oldest girl is not his daughter, but some other guy that his wife slept with early on in their marriage, got pregnant and thought she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to hide it forever (the daughters like 32 now so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have at home DNA tests back then and she probably never foresaw that being a thing). Long story short we kind of always knew because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like anyone else in that family but when they found out they all flipped on their mom about it and now the parents are getting divorced.\n\nMerry fucking Christmas'
###### b"Shit, now I'm remembering how my mom didn't want me to get a 23 and me kit last Christmas. Her reasoning was that it was a waste of 99 dollars and I could just average the results from her and my father's exams..."
###### b"I was at an eclipse party, and met a guy with a VERY interesting 23andMe story.\n\nHe was adopted, and had taken the test a couple of years ago.  To his surprise, he had something like 10 half-siblings from his father's side, from all over the country.  After contacting them, he learned that his bio-father was a serial rapist that had never been caught."
###### b'* Best case scenario: one of the kids has a different dad\n* Worst case: all of the kids have a different dad\n* Worster case: all the kids have a *different* different dad.'
###### b'I love Christmas. '
###### b'\xe2\x80\x9cand we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry but that made me giggle. '
###### b'Love the mental image of all the kids in various states of inebriation sitting in a circle playing "guess the bastard". \n\n"Lookit this guy! Lookit that fuckin\' nose! You see the rest of us with that nose?"'

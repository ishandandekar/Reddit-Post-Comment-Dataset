## Engineer is doing drugs!! No. No they aren't.
#### b"This just happened...\n\nSo, I had a laptop system board fail. Under warranty. No problem.\n\nEngineer comes on site. Does the  job. All good.\n\n10 minutes later, I'm called down to where he was working by a member of management saying that he must have been doing drugs in there because there's a syringe in the bin. There's about 10 members of staff all freaking out.\n\nIt's thermal compound.\n\nEdit: damn this got big! My biggest post ever!"

###### b'Aren\'t those like.. labeled? \n\n"Thermal Paste"?  Huh, must be slang for heroin'
###### b'Another tech office misunderstanding: once had our doc control person come up to me, the engineer in the office, and ask me "Do you know how to build a bomb?"\n\nSheepishly, I responded with "Well, I guess so, technically..."\n\nTook us a minute to realize she was leaning about our Bill Of Materials system, and had not chosen her words very carefully.'
###### b'My dad once found an empty thermal compound syringe in my room. \n\nWe had a **really** long talk.'
###### b"That reminds me, I haven't had my fix of $ColdPlace today! No wonder I was running a little hot!"
###### b"They're not even a sharps syringe, though?  None of the ones I've ever used had a needle application.  It was always a narrow plastic point.  Precise enough for what I'm doing, but not capable of piercing human skin. "
###### b"I went to a gun shop after work to get some snap caps. \n\nAs I pulled out my wallet a syringe of shin-etsu fell out of my pocket. People in line immediately called me out on it and I had to profusely explain how I'm a hardware tech and that sure as hell isn't heroin. \n\n"
###### b'We go through a lot of thermal compound, so my techs carry around the larger tubes.  While people questioning syringes is one thing, when they open ask why we put toothpaste into their computer, is a whole other conversation.'
###### b'Not a tech story but related subject matter.\n\nI used to work at Spencer\'s Gifts while in college. My manager gave me a little gift bag with random little gag gifts, a wrist band, a pen, etc.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and I\'m settling in at my Mom\'s house for Christmas break. One night I come home from hanging out with some friends, and my Mom is super concerned and slightly shaken about something.\n\n> Mom: We need to talk. I found something and I need us to talk about it and figure out what we\'re going to do.\n\n> Me: Uuuhhh... ok?\n\nI\'m really concerned now, but confused because I have nothing to hide. She pulls out this weird paper bag that she had hidden in the closet, then within the bag she carefully takes out another plastic bag which is wrapped tightly around some unknown object.\n\n> Me: Why is it wrapped up?\n\n> Mom: I didn\'t want to get any finger prints on it... \n\n> Me: What?? What the hell is it??\n\n> Mom: I think... I think it\'s a syringe.... but.. why do you have it? What have you been doing?? Tell me the truth right now.\n\nAt this point I just start laughing. This is ridiculous. I make a move to open the bag and Mom starts freaking out.\n\n> Mom: CAREFUL!!!!! YOU\'LL POKE YOURSELF! WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING!!??\n\nI tell her to calm down, everything is OK. I unwrap the bag and find the pen that I got from Spencer\'s Gifts. It\'s a big pen that has red ink which sort of looks like a syringe. I pick it up and click it once.\n\n> Mom: NOOO!!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?!\n\nI smile at her, take a nearby sheet of paper and write "I love you Mom." She looks at it for one second then just starts busting out laughing. We both laugh and hug each other for a few seconds. Easily my favorite Mom moment. (I have a lot of them. She\'s a great person.)\n\nBest part is: The pen says "Say no to drugs" on it. How in the hell did she miss that?? '
###### b'I do onsite warranty repairs and every time I pull out the thermal compound around someone that is not in IT I get weird looks. '
###### b'/u/Crescent-Argonian had a similar story:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4adp2v/the_one_time_we_got_raided_by_the_police_for/'
###### b'Man, your engineers veins must be flowing with Arctic Silver...'

###### b"When I was 17 I went to the store to buy some thermal paste for my new PC build. Got asked for ID when I was at the checkout and rejected, like wtf 'For the discerning solvent sniffer get your thermal paste' who the fuck would buy a tube of thermal paste to huff when I could go over the rode and get a load of paint for 10 times cheaper."
###### b'Thermal compound is a drug, just means the engineer is a Cylon. '

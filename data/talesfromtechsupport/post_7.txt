## "Don't bother sending a tech, I'll be dead by then"
#### b'So my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company.  The job pays well and for the most part the people I deal with are fairly nice to talk to.\n\nQuite often we\'ll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as "snow on screen" or "no signal" on their TV sets connected to our digital equipment. \n\nNow my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to TV with scrolling guide).  However most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don\'t know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your TV set on "video" or "hdmi" to get picture).  So often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues.\n\nSo anyway, I get a call from an older gentleman who\'s quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn\'t like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.).  I have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different.\n\nI spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we\'ll call him Mr. Smith) trying to get his TV set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture.  No luck.  He was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how I was useless, etc. \n\nWhatever.\n\nLike I said, I\'ve dealt with this before so I tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually I had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his TV working correctly.  Unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out.   That\'s when he dropped this on me:\n\n"Don\'t bother sending a goddamn technician, because I\'ll be dead by then.  I\'m 94 and TV is the only thing I have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?"\n\nI instantly felt bad.  I mean, I\'ve heard every complaint in the book as to why people don\'t want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me.  I\'m in my mid-20\'s so honestly I can\'t even imagine how it must feel to utter those words.\n\nSo I spoke with my supervisor, who said they\'d see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn\'t promise anything.  So I let Mr. Smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer.  \n\nAt that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after I asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help).  Man.  I felt terrible, so I took it upon myself to ask Mr. Smith if I could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where I was, not very far to drive).  \n\nHe was a little shocked I was willing to do this, but sounded thankful I was willing to come out and help him personally.\n\nSo I head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds I had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future.\n\nThat\'s when he started crying.  He goes into how he hasn\'t actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years.  He gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that I came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on.  I said it was no problem and I was happy to help, and that was it - I left.\n\n3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for "Mr. Smith".  Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really "made an old man happy again for once in a very long time".  The letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail.\n\nI guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they\'re not always a terrible person and just going through a lot.  I still think about Mr. Smith occasionally when I get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading just thought I\'d share how this one call changed my outlook on life :)\n\n'

###### b'Oh, god, when you said your supervisor called you in, I was certain the man died. Glad I was wrong.'
###### b'Well this certainly wasnt the standard tfts post I was expecting'
###### b"I work for Dell, and I'm almost certain I'd get fired for doing this"
###### b'Reminded me of this from *Grand Budapest Hotel*:\n\n> Rudeness is merely the expression of fear. People fear they won\xe2\x80\x99t get what they want. The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved, and they will open up like a flower.\n\n     -M. Gustave'
###### b"Yeah.\n\nSome years back when automatic public access wifi was non-existent, I worked at a hospital and we had to manually configure the computer for our network along with confirming you had an A/V app installed and updated.  We only allowed inpatients staying long term to have access.  They were planning a better system, but it hadn't been implemented and computer network access for patients was new.  There were some concerns as they were being placed on our production network.  \n\nBut, those tickets were priority 3.  Employee work had priority.\n\nBut, I show up in the Bone Marrow Transplant area a day after a ticket is logged.  The patient is no longer there.  Due to HIPAA I cannot be told more.\n\nIf you don't know, BMT is typically for cancer.  If the patient isn't there any longer without warning, there is likely only one reason, and it's not a happy one.\n\nThis really bummed me out.  I mean, I had tears.  I thought about some poor guy wanting to reach out via internet to send a few last emails, see a vacation spot he once visited, whatever he wanted and our policy and my workload prevented that.\n\nI went to the boss and told him these cases need to be priority 2 and go to the top of the queue for P2 cases.  P1's were only where medical care was being prevented by the outage- patient in the room who can't get care.  I about broke down giving my justifications and said if he said no, I'd go each step up the IT management ladder all the way to the CEO to make my case.  My point was this is the 21st century and how would you feel about a hospital where hooking up a phone in your room was a special project?\n\nHe approved the change and we started giving patients higher priority.  \n\nAbout a year after, we had a rich guy who had a nephew stay in the BMT, and he then donated enough computers to put a laptop in each room.  We locked them down for malware/virus and would reimage after each patient left and it all worked out.\n\nKudos to the Ft. Worth Cats minor league baseball team management for that donation.  \n\n"
###### b'>doesn\'t like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.\n\nI do want to address that. It really matters what your phone tree says and how long it takes. I recently tried to make a call and was put through a very long phone tree to "better identify my problem." But first I was told that *to save time with the agent* I needed to give them my social, my pin, my phone number and verify my address. I did all of the above and went through many choices until I had helped the system identify exactly what the problem was.\n\nThen an agent answers. He asks me for all of the same information all over again and then asks me "what seems to be the problem?" Thank God we saved all that time.\n\nLOL'
###### b"Nice try OP. Trying to make me believe that cable companies are made up of people with human emotions and sympathies. I'm on to you!"
###### b'Alternitive ending (with my luck)\n\n"3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for "Mr. Smith". Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really "made an old man happy again for once in a very long time".  \n  \nMy boss told me that I violated company policy by agreeing to meet a client outside of work, while on a company phone on company time. I was fired for misconduct."'
###### b'I once sold an old man a digital camera or something at CompUSA. I offered him the extended service plan and he said, "I\'m 92 years old, I don\'t even buy green bananas." I laughed and didn\'t push it. I hated selling those things. \n\n'
###### b'Well done OP.  Looks like the single point of failure was the human interface on the other end of the phone line.  By bypassing the failed human interface and accessing the equipment directly you resolved the problem.\n\nSeriously though, way to go the extra mile.  I hope you wind up getting more than just a pat on the back for it in the long run (like a raise at your next performance review).'
###### b"I'm a carer in a nursing home and this exactly why people should not feel bad about putting older loved ones in homes. Some of the residents we have are so happy to be able to interact with people everyday (even if they hate that we take away a lot of their freedom)."
###### b"This is the first story I've ever read on TFTS. Maybe I should stop now"
###### b'This is also part of the reason the isolated elderly people can fall victim to door to door and telephone scams.\n\nSome are so lonely, they enjoy the attention and company and are willing to pay for it even if it\'s a scam. \n\nDamn sad situation.\n\nThere is a fascinating book on technology and isolation and how with our increasing technology, we are ironically alienating ourselves from each other more.  \n\n"Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other" by Sherry Turkle.  \n\nOne of the interesting devices she talks about is Paro, a baby seal like robot used to soothe patients.\n\nhttp://www.parorobots.com/\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Robotic-stuffed-seal-helps-soothe-seniors-5568674.php\n\nIn the book she describes how a person will be given one of these and they\'ll say "this is the dumbest thing in the world" and a half hour later they\'ll be telling it their life story and secrets they won\'t tell their kids.  \n\nThe author isn\'t sure if this is good or bad.\n\nIt covers a lot about this new first generation who have grown up with cell phone tech.  It seems like a paradigm shift in the way humans interact with each other, and as she says, the tech is effecting the ways we interact when not using the technology, too.\n\nDamn good read although I\'m not really too comfortable with her psychoanalytic approach.\n\n'
###### b'I had a similar experience working for cable support.\n\nGot a call for internet support from an old lady. I worked on Vancouver Island in BC, and out there calls from seniors were pretty common. This particular old lady asked me if I could help her "get rid of her email".\n\nInitially, I didn\'t understand. Did she want to delete her ISP-provided email? No, she didn\'t care about that. She just wanted to get rid of her email. After some more questions, I realized she wanted to remove outlook express from her computer entirely. I calmly explained that removing OE was very difficult (back in the XP days when it came with the computer as a core windows component), and she could just remove her account. That wasn\'t good enough for her, she didn\'t want to see the email icon anymore.\n\nI asked her why. I\'ll never forget what she told me: \n\n"I don\'t get many emails anymore, all my friends are dead".\n\nShe went on to explain how she used to get a ton of emails all the time from her friends, but now as she\'s gotten older they\'ve passed away and she\'s tired of the email program reminding her that she has no one to send email to and no email to receive anymore. \n\nNow, it was 8 pm on a weeknight. Call volume was pretty low. I had a half an hour left in my shift and no one waiting in line. I decided to screw my call stats and talk to her for a while. We ended up talking for about a half an hour. I hadn\'t lived in the city long, so she gave me a lot of advice about nice places to go and things to see. She talked about her favourite church ("the choir is amazing, you just have to see them, they won an award!"), and all the things she loved about the city.\n\nAt the end of the call, she thanked me, and had completely forgotten about the email. '
###### b'Good thing your boss was okay with it. When I worked with Dish Network, I once had a caller that could not understand my instructions, and the thing was that they literally lived right across the street to the call center. I off-hand suggested walking over on my lunch break and doing it myself instead of sending a tech a week from then, and I almost got fired on the spot. Not all companies appreciate the extra mile.'

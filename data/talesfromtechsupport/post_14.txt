#### b"Here's another tale from the out of hours hell desk... This gem happened a few days ago.\n\n**Me:** Service Desk\n\n**Caller:** THE SERVER IS DOWN YOU NEED TO FIX THIS NOW\n\n**Me:** Which server are you referring to?\n\n**Caller:** THE SERVER!\n\n**Me:** *okay...* what is it that you are trying to do?\n\n**Caller:** TRYING TO ACCESS THE GOD DAMN SERVER\n\n(yes, she was SHOUTING the entire time)\n\n**Me:** Please can you stop shouting at me and tell me which server you are talking about or what it is that you are trying to do? <business we support> has many different servers for different things, I need to know exactly what isn't working?\n\n**Caller:** HOLY CRAP THE SERVER ISN'T WORKING. THE. SERVER. ISN'T. WORKING. YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME.\n\n(In the background I've already loaded up our server monitoring tools - no alerts)\n\n**Me:** I've checked our monitoring, I'm not seeing any servers as being down. Which department are you calling from?\n\n**Caller:** IRRELEVANT. FIX THE GOD DAMN SERVER NOW.\n\n**Me:** Can I get your Staff ID please?\n\n**Caller:** IRRELEVANT.  *click*\n\n10 minutes later...\n\n**Me:** Service Desk\n\n**Caller:** HOLY CRAP THE GOD DAMN SERVER IS STILL DOWN!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS?\n\n**Me:** Nothing.\n\n**Caller:** EXCUSE ME? *NOTHING?* \n\n**Me:** You still haven't told me which server is down or what is not actually working?\n\n**Caller:** YOU PEOPLE! IT'S OBVIOUS MY PHONE ISN'T WORKING I CAN'T MAKE CALLS. THE SERVER HAS GONE DOWN YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR PEOPLE AND FIX THIS.\n\n**Me:** Ma'am I can see you are calling me from your Desk Phone, <ext> is that correct?\n\n**Caller:** YES!\n\n**Me:** and this is the phone you can not make calls from, correct? \n\n**Caller:** YES!\n\n**Me:** ...\n\n**Me:** Do you see why I'm having trouble understanding the problem?\n\n**Caller:** THE SERVER IS DOWN I CAN'T CALL <obviously not a valid number>\n\n**Me:** Ma'am that number is 3 digits short of a valid number, that is why the call is not connecting.\n\n**Caller:** LISTEN THE SERVER IS OBVIOUSLY DOWN. I'LL HAVE MY PEOPLE CALL YOUR PEOPLE ABOUT THIS! *click*\n\nI love my job. I love my job. I love my job."

###### b'>*Mouse isn\'t working*\n\n>HELP THE SERVER IS DOWN THE SERVER IS DOWN\n\nAlso reminds me of a story from somewhere on reddit. Guy gets a sysadmin job at a small business, where the last guy didn\'t properly implement anything. New sysadmin rebuilds network/server from scratch, with redundant failovers and offline backups, with an entire new network from 10/100 to gigabit.\n\nPresents all this to the CEO/high-levels about his progress. CEO clicks around on his computer and moves his window around. "Seems like the same speed to me!"'
###### b'So did you get the server up?!?'
###### b'Ah users. They hear a phrase once and it sort of sticks but they never get it right. It\'s a little like people who have theasurus syndrome.\n\nSometime, somewhere, she heard someone say "the server is down" in reference to a computer problem (defined as "a problem involving absolutely anything that plugs into a wall").\n\nSince she doesn\'t understand anything she therefore decided this magic phrase was the explanation for any problem. There\'s a computer problem (since her phone plugs into the wall therefore it\'s a computer problem) and that means "the server is down".\n\nShe thinks she\'s found a magic way to cut through the BS and embarrassment of admitting ignorance and actually answering all of our annoying questions she doesn\'t know how to answer, and just get IT to fix the dam problem by speaking in their own arcane gobbledygook and now she\'s mad at you for failing to do your part, respond to the magic words, and fix her problem.'
###### b'"Can you people stop messing with The Bing! I need my Bing to work, the server is down and I can\'t access my Bing." - Google Bing Lady'
###### b'"Nothing."\n\nOh dear god I would LOVE to be able to say that! It just seems like it would feel so gooooood!'
###### b"I read a story once how an IT guy inspired his minions/team to be more accurate when describing issues:\n  \nIf you are the first person to tell me that the server is down and it actually is, you will receive $10. \n  \nIf you tell me the server is down and it's working properly, you will pay me $10.  \n  \n"
###### b'How do people who are this stupid gain employment?'
###### b"Look dude, I don't know what is so hard about this. They provided zero information or context to the problem while using incorrect terminology and you have your IT magic to fix the problem. What's so hard about fixing it?"
###### b'My personal rule is that I ask them once to stop yelling, then warn them I will hang up, then I hang up. Fuck that shit. '
###### b'I worked at a very large privately owned company who was in the final stages of moving all support to a central office and having the people at the remote offices do only their core duties instead of spending time fucking around with services and technology they had no idea how to use.\n \nThe remote office VPs did not like this, but it was mandated by the CEO. They still threw fits every time something was not as they wanted it... And constantly blamed my people for it.\n \nSo I got permission to run an experiment... We told everyone that we would be making server updates over the weekend. We then went home and did nothing. We come back to several VPs screaming that "EVER SINCE THE CHANGE I CANT DO X, THIS WORKED ON FRIDAY FIX IT NAO OMGWTFBBQ".\n \nCIO got them all on a conference call with my people. They were ready to ream us. CIO asks... Ok guys, what changes were made this weekend?\n \nAnd thus we explained that we made no changes; that we sent out the email as a test to see if the remote VPs were causing issues, and CIO confirmed that we made no changes & further that he was in on the plan.\n \nIt was very quiet after that.'
###### b'"Is the server is down?"\n\nAh...the oldest one in the book. I still get it after 19+ years doing tech-support...and I still have to explain that we run dozens of servers and politely ask what they are doing that isn\'t working.'
###### b'I was IT at CNN once, a long time ago. In the days when everyone had terminals, not PCs. (We were switching everyone over as part of my job.) The terminals were old, they\'d go down a lot. Sometimes on air (that was a panic) sometimes just middle of the day.\n\nI got a call from a very famous personality at CNN, someone known to be not very nice. They screamed at me on the phone that their terminal wasn\'t working, the keys stopped working. I grabbed a keyboard and headed down. \n\nI get there and the terminal is up, but yeah, the keys don\'t work. I\'m getting yelled at for the lack of maintenance of the terminals.\n\nThen I notice there\'s an empty bottle of water next to the keyboard. \n\nI picked the keyboard up, turn it upside down and watch it rain water onto the desk.\n\n"Something you want to tell me?" I say calmly. She blushes, apologizes and tells me that maybe she spilled a little water on it. \n\nWHERE DID SHE THINK THE WATER WAS GOING TO GO THAT I WOULDN\'T NOTICE?'
###### b'Similar instance where a user sent an email to help desk with subject "EMAIL SERVER IS DOWN"'
###### b'One of our office legends around here is from and after-hours call I took nearly 20 years ago. One Firday night the after-hours phone rings. I let it go to voice mail because some clients don\'t relize what time it is and usally they don\'t want to pay for an after-hours call, so the voice mail is a tipp-off that it\'s after hours. If they leave a message I\'ll call them right back, SOP. Phone dings for a new voice mail. I pick it up and listen to the message. You need this image. A hesitant Asian ladies voice says. "Server down, you fix" End of message, no client name, no call back number nothing. Since this call is routed though and ACD queue there isn\'t any of that information available to try to figure out who it was. I fully expect to get another call in an hour or so, but nothing. Monday morning I come in and expect someone to come ask why I didn\'t call so and so back, but nothing. I payed the message for my manager, she laughed, no one in the department recognized the voice. To this day I don\'t know who it was or what the problem was.'

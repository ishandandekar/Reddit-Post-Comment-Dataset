## When the drive for a new iPhone is too great, you get fired.
#### b'I work as an Executive Support Technician for a large company, I have a team of 8 people under me and we support high ranking executives and their administrative assistants.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of our work, we have the ability to "get things done" that the standard help desk cannot, We can force upgrades that would otherwise be denied, get things expedited, skip the normal procedures and talk directly with the people who fix the issues. \n\n\nWhile we are executive support, there are still levels, when the CEO is in town, one of us is camped outside of where ever he might be in case there is any sort of issue. \n\nFor lower people, we make sure things get done as quick as possible, but it\'s not a drop everything situation.\n\nAs we prepped for the releases of the new iPhones, we braced for the flood of "I NEED this" that inevitably happens.  We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing. \n\nSo on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X\'s\n\nThe Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied.  She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about "I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc" \n\nStill denied.\n\nOn Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.\n\nI send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.\n\nthe EA states "I was using it and it fell into my water bottle" \n\nSo we take the phone back to our area and I\'ve called my manager over and we explain it, It\'s obvious what has happened,  We\'ve toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen. \n\nWell as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.\n\n10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can\'t work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don\'t give her one "EXECUTIVE" will make us give her one.  I step in and tell her "A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced"\n\nQueue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone.  This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of "EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS" and statements of "I can\'t believe this is happening to me, how will I work?" \n\nWednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement.  I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back.  I calmly ask "What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?"\n\nThe reply: "Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn\'t fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs."\n\nWell ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.\n\nOn the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.\n\nShe picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs. \n\nSo we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it. \n\nTermination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.  \n\n7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.\n\n8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she\'s alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she\'s being framed.\n\nAs she\'s brought through the main foyer, I\'m on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.\n\nBoth phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution. Company policy when there is a messy separation.\n\nMaybe I\'ll buy my team pizza for lunch today, seems like the right thing to do.\n\nTLDR; Executive Assistant breaks iPhones in her quest to get an iPhone X, gets unemployment instead.

###### b'She did all this to get an iPhone X? What was her plan for the month+ before the iPhone X actually ships?'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b"This isn't normal stupid... this is *advanced* stupid."
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'Please tell me she has to pay for the damaged property! You have the video evidence.'
###### b'I strongly dislike when people treat hardware like this. Not the money...but just... poor device..'
###### b'I knew how this story would be going once I read the title.\n\nHow can be somebody that stupid, even if you are not an at will employee in a lot of locations intentional destruction of company assets is enough cause to fire you and if you are not amongst the first people to get a new gadget then you are also unlikely to be amongst the people who can get away with it not just once but twice.'
###### b'You know its gon be guud when you say "as luck would have it, we have spares.."'
###### b"And I'm sure she will tell everyone, and probably truly believe it herself, that you are the entire reason she was fired."
###### b'Too real man. We had an employee who left their work computer (snazzy macbook pro) in a cab. The replacement was one Gen behind but as far as he was concerned it was a trial from the devil himself and he DEMANDED a *working* computer.\n\nWhen we proved at every turn that the machine he had was more than sufficient to carry out his tasks and that his claims of "nothing works and it takes 5 minutes to boot" were categorically false, all the sudden it has "liquid damage from before he got it that all the sudden worked it\'s way through enough to damage it".\n\nBrought it in, full of beer. (The macbook)\n\n6 days later he got a brand new top of the line touch bar MBP and I lost all respect for our administration. '
###### b'I like your thought process here, and I really like the options presented by commenters, however.....  I\xe2\x80\x99ve been handed company cell phones since the last guy departed. I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing a bunch of this shit going on. One guy even claimed that his phone was stolen. \n\nLuckily for me, I issued stolen iPhone dude\xe2\x80\x99s iCloud information and told him to reset. They never do, so I was able to log in and use find my iPhone to locate. It was on site.....  I also had a hunch that this not so bright individual actually had the phone on him as I heard a buzz while talking to him (he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a personal). What did I do?  I loaded Find My iPhone on my phone and as I was about 2 feet away from him I said \xe2\x80\x9cHey, I think I found your phone\xe2\x80\x9d then proceeded to turn on the beeper at max volume. It was in his pocket. \n\nI looked at his pocket and said \xe2\x80\x9cHuh...  there it is\xe2\x80\x9d and walked away. '
###### b'How can people be so fucking stupid. Unbelievable.  \nI need to tell IT and HR I need 1080Ti for my office work... and administration rights.'
###### b"Don't think about getting your co-workers pizza, just do it.\nThe little things like getting a simple comfort food for your guys let's them know you are one of them and you appreciate them. Brings up morale after dealing with people like the EA."
###### b'Hope the new assistant gets an iPhone X.'
###### b'Ah, when the EA starts to pretend or believe they don\xe2\x80\x99t have admin or assistant in their title. Gotta love those people. How did her boss take it?'

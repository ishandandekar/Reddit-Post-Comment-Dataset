## "My data hasn't been working for 20 minutes and I want compensation."
#### b'So I had a customer call me up in mobile tech support with the problem that his data wasn\'t working for 20 minutes, pretty quickly I find out why; he had accidentally turned off his data on the phone menu (which happens a lot but usually the customer goes "oops silly me"). So this customer starts demanding that he want\'s compensation for his time without service and being very rude about it. After a couple of minutes he\'s not taking this is not something we did, but his mistake as a answer, so I get an idea, I tell him I\'m going to go speak to my manager. I went up to my manager, explain what\'s happening, he says the customer\'s being ridiculous and I said, \n\n>"Listen I have this idea for him, are you okay with this?" then explain my idea.\n\n>"Are you kidding? Let me get on call listening before you go back, I wanna hear this."\n\nI go back to the phone, he gave me the thumbs up that he was ready to listen and I proceed.\n\n>"Right sir, I just had a word with my manager and I\'ve managed to swing something for you, so let\'s break this down, you pay us 39.99 a month for 3 services; calls, texts and data, so let\'s divide your bill by 3 that give us 13.33, so let\'s divide further by 30 days to gives 44 pence for your daily data, now you had your data turned off for 20 minutes but for the purpose of this I\'ll round it up to an hour so we just need to divide that 44 pence by 24 hours so that means your looking at compensation of 1.8 pence so let\'s just say 2."\n\nI looked over at my manager during and he was covering his mouth laughing. Customer goes;\n\n>"Are you having a f@#king laugh?"\n\n>"No sir the math is there."\n\n>"............Go on then I\'ll take it"\n\n\n*Edit* Yaaaay My first Gold, thank you kind person'

###### b'I love that he took the 2 pence. 99% of people would have hung up on you, or demanded more or shouted abuse, this guy is just "ok then"'
###### b"Hey, you asked for my two cents, and now I'm giving it to you"
###### b"Should have used the exact 20 minutes, gotten 0.6 pence and then told him that it's policy to round down."
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'Your manager sounds like a pretty fun guy. (And you too, of course) :D'
###### b'Should have rounded up to half an hour :P'
###### b">Are you having a f@#cking laugh?\n\n>Everyone in the office but me, sir. And, I'm having a bit of a time restraining myself. Now would you like a credit, or a check mailed to your residence?"
###### b'It sounds like he spent more on the phone call to you than he got back...'
###### b'"A Service fee of 1.95 will apply to this refund transaction. Thank you and have a wonderful day."'
###### b'I had one of those data moments. My first smartphone, had it hooked to my house wifi. I noticed one day that my phone would cease to have a connection if I left my house. Strange. So after a week of being annoyed that my phone was pretty much useless outside of my house, which is really the only place I needed it, I went to the store and asked them why. The look on the guys face as he took my phone, opened the menu, and turned the data back on was priceless. I felt beyond stupid.'
###### b'Did this when I worked for an ISP all the time. People wanted compensation for their internet being out for 20-30 minutes etc. Manager wondered why i had so many 5-10 cent reimbursements i said listen to some of my calls, you will find out lol'
###### b'I deal with a ton of lawyers, and often they will say, I bill at 300 dollars per hour and this took up 2 hours of my time, I want you to pay me. \n\nYea, thats going to happen, because you couldnt follow directions.'
###### b'He should come to Australia. Having it work for 20 minutes is a blessing. '
###### b'Somewhat similar situation at the rental place I work at when we had cops shut down our 4th of July pool event. \n\nIt\'s in a college town and we had it controlled but there were too many people. \n\nBiggest comment was "my parents pay 800 a month for me not to use the pool?!" \n\nActually did the math and they lost around 2 dollars from their daily rate because the cops told us to shut it down. '
###### b"I've done this. Prorated a refund down to the minute for the outage. If they weren't yelling, i'd have given them another month of subscription free of charge."

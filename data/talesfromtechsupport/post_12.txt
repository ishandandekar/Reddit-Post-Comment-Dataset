## Literally, my one-year-old can figure this stuff out
#### b'If this is the wrong sub, please let me know. \n\nI spent three shitty years working in a call center, two of which I was roped into acting as tech support, despite the fact that I\'d originally been hired to sell insurance. The calls I got made me weep for humanity. After my son was born, I decided not to return from maternity leave. I just couldn\'t handle staying up all night with a screaming newborn, and then coming in to work and calmly asking people how the hell they can\'t see the huge red "CREATE AN ACCOUNT" button smack-dab in the middle of the page, but they can find our phone number in tiny font up in the corner to call and demand that we do it for them. \n\nWell, you guys, my baby is now a toddler, and I just had that misty-eyed, hand-on-heart, proud parent moment that you always hear about. My son was playing with his Brilliant Baby Laptop, which is basically a bright plastic clamshell that plays music when the baby mashes the keyboard. Suddenly, the music stopped. The baby was confused. Further button-mashing had no effect. I watched from the sofa as my son frowned, experimentally smashing the buttons harder. Then, as I looked on in amazement and pride, *he turned it off and on again.* "Welcome!" It announced, the screen lighting up in a joyful display. My son contentedly returned to his button-mashing, and I shed a proud tear. So what if your kid can say "mommy" and "daddy" and knows how to use a spoon? Mine can *troubleshoot!* '

###### b'So we have evidence that the tech support aura is inheritable.'
###### b'Friend of mine does tech support and had a kid a few years back. Takes son to doctor when he\'s a toddler for a check-up on his development. Dr shows kid some cards with letters and asks Liam if he knows what the letters are. \'P\', \'W\', \'D\' shouts Liam with glee. "That\'s great Liam, how do you know those letters?" asks the Dr. "P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D" shouts Liam, "that\'s what I put in my computer". Dr looks at proud father "He\'ll be just fine".'
###### b"Cute kid story and following rule 1 of tech support?  This isn't just sub-worthy, this could go front page."
###### b'Ya know, I\'d really like for there to be a series of YouTube videos which show a two-year-old solving various common problems that users always seem to have issues with. Just so I can show them to people and say "Literally, a two-year-old can figure this out."'
###### b'When my kids were little (6, 5, 3) I let them play "Bailey\'s Book House".  Fun kids game with numbers, colors, and shapes.  It was a DOS game so I wrote a quick BAT file that started the game in a loop.  If they exited the game, it would restart.\n\nOne day the kids wanted to play Bailey\'s, so I started it and walked away.  A little later I heard, "Bloosh, you found it!".  Not remembering any "blooshes" in Bailey\'s I took a quick peak.  My daughter (3 y/o) managed to break out of the BAT file and started Windows, then Minesweeper.  They were playing, "...click, click, BLOOSH, you found it!".\n\nShe\'s grown up now and works as a Linux Tech at a company that rhymes with Backspace.'
###### b'Right after Win98 came out, I had my two year old son playing a toddler games on the PC.  He could boot up the PC, find the icon on the screen and launch it all by himself.  One day I wanted to show off my kid\'s computer prowess to a friend of mine, who was m a manager of engineers.  With my friend watching, the unexpected happened...\n\nI asked my son to show my friend the game.  My son turned on the PC and waited for it to boot.  Once booted, he discovered that the mouse didn\'t work.  My son calmly pulled on the mouse cord until the plug was in his hand.  He spun the pc around, looked at the plug carefully (remember that back then it was a round DIN plug), looked at the back panel, found the only open spot that the plug could fit, plugged it in, spun the PC around and launched the game as if nothing special happened.\n\nMy friend could not believe what had just happened.  He later told me that he had engineers on his staff who would have not been able to do what my two year old just did.\n\nI don\'t believe that my kid has special computer powers, rather I think it is because he had no fear of breaking the new fangled and expensive thing. My son is from the first generation of people who has a PC in the home from birth.  Older engineers can\'t compete because they knew how expensive the box is (was) and are simply afraid to try stuff on their own.\n\nI see the same thing today.  I often am asked how to do something on a web site, like create a new account.  I walk up and ask them "don\'t you see the ginormous button labeled create a new account".  Of course they do, they are just too afraid to push it.'
###### b'When I worked at Directv I was not above asking to speak to the toddler. \n\n\nToddlers have a skill that many adults do not.  They can follow simple directions'
###### b"Reminds me of a friend I had several years ago. (I really want to get back in touch, but my awkwardness makes it difficult.)\n\nAnyway, he and his wife were both coders, and his wife was going for a master's in CS. He had been working with her on the concept of [deadlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock), with little success.\n\nIn comes their toddler son, being curious as always. (The kid was always smart as a whip.)\n\nMy friend begins to explain the concept of deadlocks to his son, using a pencil and paper as the resources. You see, you need both a pencil and some paper to write. If I have the pencil, and you have the paper, one of us has to give up what we have so the other can write, and then once that person is done, the other can get both. Computers aren't that smart so they have to make sure they can get both things they need before they get any of them, or otherwise they have to start all over.\n\nAnd the kid got it *immediately.* "
###### b'Bravo, mamma!  You should be proud!\n\nWhen I write instructions for computer usage, I was using my 8 year old to \xe2\x80\x98test\xe2\x80\x99 the clarity of the instructions. \n\nNow I realize my mistake.  Way too high on expectations of end users.'
###### b'Not nearly as good, when my nephew was about that age, my mom was watching him while his mom worked.  She had gone to drop him off, and they got to talking.  My nephew was bored, apparently, and they were semi-ignoring him, so he went and turned on the DVD player, got his favorite Backyardigans DVD out of it\'s case and into the DVD player, and got the show running.\n\nAt another point not long after (Maybe 2 years old?) I was talking to the sister-in-law on the phone and she mentioned that she was tired.  I then heard the nephew in the background say "You need a double-double" (Canadian slang for a coffee with 2 cream, 2 sugar)\n\nKids are sponges, man.'
###### b'This is one of the most awesome posts I have ever read here! Train them early!'
###### b"I was so proud when my baby-toddler figured out how to use the iPad like a pro. She can switch videos in YouTube when the ads come on (although I removed YouTube since I cannot stand fucking Johnny Johnny). She uses Siri. She switches apps, she presses X's to close things. "
###### b"That's awesome! \n\nOne day when my daughter was about 2, our land line went out.   My husband's phone battery was dead because this was before the days of smart phone addiction.   So he grabbed my BlackBerry but was flummoxed.  My daughter toddles over, unlocks the phone, asks for the number and dials it, then when the phone started  ringing shoves it at Daddy and walks away. \n\nAnother kid with inherited or congenital technical abilities.

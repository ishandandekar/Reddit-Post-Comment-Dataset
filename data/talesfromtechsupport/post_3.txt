## No sir, I can't show you how to commit a federal crime
#### b'The repair company I work at is a small business and has two locations, one of which is in an interesting area. As such, we get a lot of interesting people. This guy came in yesterday. \n\n**$User:** "Hi, can you show me how to access someone\'s text messages? I found some tutorials on YouTube but they didn\'t work"  \n*I assume he wants to backup the messages so I start walking him through how to sync his phone*  \n**$User:** "No no no, I want someone else\'s messages"  \n**$Me:** "Wait, this isn\'t a device you own?"  \n**$User:** "No"  \n**$Me:** "Do you have consent from the owner to read their messages?"  \n**$User:** "No, that\'s why I need you to show me how to see them"  \n**$Me:** "Sir, if you don\'t have permission from the other person to read their messages it\'s illegal to access them. I can\'t show you how to do that here"  \n**$User:** "Well do you know anywhere else that can"  \n$Me: "No sir, I\'m not aware of any other repair shops that can help you do that, it\'s a federal crime. I can pull up the relevant laws regarding unauthorized access to someone\'s personal devices if you\'d like"\n\n*Cue standard rant of "you guys are supposed to be the experts" as I stare blankly into the distance losing more faith in humanity*'

###### b'My standard answer for "you\'re supposed to be a professional" after declining to do something is "exactly, that\'s why I said no".'
###### b'"Sir, I am sorry someone is clipping your chick, but you need to move on. If you\'re married, get a lawyer."'
###### b'In cases like this (and this is an extreme as federal crimes are involved) I always think of a bit from Penn and Teller\'s classic "How to Play with Your Food".  \n\nOne of the chapters is how to make a pickle glow in the dark.  I have seen it done and it\'s a fun nerd party trick (the Ba-Tampte pickled tomatoes work even better as they become glowing orbs).  \n\nThe text basically says "You run electric current through the pickle.  If you have to ask any more questions about how, you definitely shouldn\'t be doing it."  \n\nEDIT:  Wow, my most popular ever Reddit comment!  Y\'all have some great stories and "Electric Pickle" will be the name of my Sixties cover band.   For some of you, I think they might have said "house current" (it\'s been a while) which may provide all the info you need.  '
###### b"I got this same thing once but they had the phone with them. I could tell right off the bat that this gold iPhone in a pink sparkle case wasn't this 45 year old mans. "
###### b'"Hold on Sir, I call in our Expert"\n\n*calls police*'
###### b"Take the person's phone... commit felony and get arrested. Cops will  crack/copy the contents of the phone. Viola! The cops did the work for you.\n\nNow just FOIA that info after you get out of jail 10 years later and you have those messages you wanted."
###### b'At this point you refer them to the police with some made up nonsense about how all they have to do is show cause and the cops will help them.'
###### b"Even if it wasn't a crime or ethically wrong (it is, but hypothetically), that's not something 1) you can call a repair shop for 2) depending on the device or service, not something that is always possible 3) just... not very nice to do to someone"
###### b'You still have faith in humanity? Get a load of this guy over here.'
###### b'See, this is the point where you need to start fucking with him.\n\n"OK, look, I know how to do this and I\'ll show you, but you didn\'t hear it from me, got it?"\n\n"Yeah, of course!"\n\n"OK, you go into your messages and....oh...."\n\n"What?"\n\n"Well, you see how you can see the time and date the message was sent? That\'s bad."\n\n"What do you mean, I\'ve always seen that."\n\n"Always? Like, since you first got the phone?"\n\n"Well, yeah, of course!"\n\n"....sir, I\'m not sure who you are or what you do for a living, but you need to know that you have some very powerful enemies. Think 3 letter organizations."\n\n"What the hell are you talking about? It logs the time the message was received, so what?"\n\n"I\'m not going to say anything more, this conversation is probably being recorded."\n\n"What?"\n\n"I DO NOT KNOW THIS MAN. HE WALKED INTO MY SHOP OF HIS OWN FREE WILL. I FORMALLY REQUEST ASYLUM UNDER ARTICLE 3.14.158 OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION."'

###### b'My aunt asked me to do this to my uncle and I was just like, "ah, no."'
###### b'"actually sir, I do know someone who can help. Just go to this [website](https://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx) and email them for help."'
###### b"I can't believe he didn't even have the decency to bribe you"
###### b'"Yes sir, I am an expert.  An expert of staying out of jail.  Can I show you the door or can you find it yourself?"'

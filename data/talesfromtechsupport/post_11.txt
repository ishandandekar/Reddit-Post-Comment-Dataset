## A good answer for when you're pulled over.
#### b"LTLFTPETC.\n \nI hope you will forgive me for a third hand story, but I'm one of those evil developers, not a support per se. But I thought you'd enjoy this story anyway. So this happened to a colleague of a colleague:\n \n**$Hero** - our hero. **$Cop** - A representative of our hard worked law enforcement agency.\n \nSo $Hero is happily speeding along in his car, running a few yellow lights a bit late, etc. Finally, the law catches up to him and pulls him over. Here's how the conversation went:\n \n**$Cop**: Can I see your driving license, please?\n \n**$Hero** (with smug grin): Certainly. Here it is, officer.\n \n**$Cop** takes license back to motorcycle and speaks into radio.\n \n**$Hero**: It's not going to help you any, though.\n \n**$Cop** (with no reaction): What do you mean?\n \n**$Hero** (with wider grin): The server you have to check it against is down.\n \n**$Cop** (still no reaction): And why do you say that?\n \n**$Hero**: Because I'm the guy they called to get on site and get it up again.\n \nOur hero did not get a fine this time. Instead he got a police escort to his workplace."

###### b'I would be completely smug in that situation too.'
###### b'I caused a friend to have a similar encounter with the local police once. We had just left a bowling alley around 1am, and the brakes on my car failed at low speed, so I pulled off in the middle of town, and called my friend to come back and pick me up. An officer pulled up shortly afterwards wondering what was happening, and I showed him the puddle of brake fluid under the car. He went on his way after I explained that my friend was coming to pick me up.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later my friend pulls up and explains that after he turned around, he got pulled over for doing 85 in a 55. The first thing the officer did was to ask if he was on his way to get the guy broken down in town (me), and let him go with a "Slow it down please."'
###### b"I was expecting a different ending:\n\n---\n$Cop takes license back to motorcycle and speaks into radio.\n\n$Hero: It's not going to help you any, though.\n\n$Cop (with no reaction): What do you mean?\n\n$Hero (teleports behind $Cop, blade at the ready): nothing personal, kid."
###### b'Many years ago in central California I had a janitorial job that included cleaning the offices of the local police department (vacuuming, emptying trash, swabbing toilets, etc). During one particular early in the morning shift my cleaning partner and I decided to take a little break, drive a few blocks away, and partake in some of mother nature\'s finest in the form of a rather generous marijuana cigarette (aka "joint").\n\nHalf-way through this delightful bit of heaven we were mortified to be lit up by Johnny Law. It seems one of the neighborhood watchful had noticed our suspicious vehicle parked there glowing from within as we passed the joint back & forth and called 911 to declare an "emergency" as somebody was clearly having more fun than she was.\n\nAfter a bit of conversation the officer came to realize that he could 1) bust us for possession and suffer the consequences of being the officer responsible for the police station not being cleaned that night or 2) let us go with a stern warning so we could do our job. He chose #2, but kept our roach.\n\nI now live in Texas, and sometimes really really miss California.'

###### b'When /r/talesfromtechsupport and /r/TalesFromTheSquadCar collide.'
###### b'When I worked 911 I watch something similar go down on my computer. We dispatched for several departments that all neighbored each other and one departments area sat on a major highway and they loved to set speed traps. Well 2 officers from the main department ended up being a bit late to work so they get caught by the speed trap. We all had a laugh when we ran the plates saw one of our guys names then suddenly the traffic stop was ended with no citation. The first time it was gold, the second time made our day.'

###### b'I would not recommend being smug with the cops (depending on what your town is like). It worked for OPs friend but could have easily gone in a completely different direction.'
###### b"Wouldn't a colleague of a colleague also be your colleague?"
###### b"I've heard a similar story from South Africa, except the server he was rushing to bring back up was the Police Department's payroll system."
###### b"What's wrong with going through a yellow light?\n\nAnd why be a smart ass to a cop? "
###### b"If driving in Canada as an American just say confused by the km's.  Never actually tried this but it was my plan when going 95 through Jasper NP."

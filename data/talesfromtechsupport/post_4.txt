## "I need you to fix Google Bing immediately!"
#### b'Another tale from the out of hours IT desk...\n\n**Me:** Service Desk\n\n**Caller:** GOOGLE BING ISNT WORKING IS THE SYSTEM DOWN ??? ITS VERY IMPORTANT I USE THE BING\n\n*Note: yes, caller actually said "the bing"*\n\n**Me:** I\'m sorry - can you confirm which system you\'re referring to as I\'m unfamiliar with that\n\n**Caller:** Google Bing! Really how can you not know this\n\n**Me:** Google Bing is not a system we support out of hours nor in hours. This sounds like a mash up between two different search engines. What exactly is happening?\n\n**Caller:** I need Google Bing to do my job! This is unacceptable. I can\'t find Google Bing anywhere on my PC. How dare you remove this! I need you to fix Google Bing immediately!\n\n**Me:** May I remote in to take a look\n\n<spend 5 mins setting up remote connection>\n\nTurns out that caller had a shortcut on her desktop called "Google Bing" - this opened the Bing Search homepage in Google Chrome *shivers*. She\'d accidentally changed the name of the shortcut from "Google Bing" to something else and hence could not find it.\n\n**Me:** okay - that has been renamed now so you\'re good to go\n\n**Caller:** next time don\'t mess around with my computer! I know you guys changed this, I\'m not stupid! I have a certificate of proficiency in computering\n\n**Me:** okay thanks for calling *click*\n\n*Note: yes caller really said "computering"*\n\nI died a little inside after taking this call.'

###### b'> I have a certificate of proficiency in computering!\n\nYes, it came from cheap-online-certificates.com for a discounted price, no study required!'
###### b'Computering the Bing is my new euphemism for performing tech support. '
###### b'This is one of those threads where we can\'t say "they are not a computer person".\n\nIn this case they are not merely a computer person but a fully certified and proficient computering person. They have achieved the next level, I wonder what comes after that.'
###### b'I love my father. He\'s an amazing man with a wonderful sense of humour who taught me confidence, the value of remaining calm and patience as a virtue.\n\nMy father, realising IT would be the future, took a course in \'computering\' ... you know, the \'how to turn on, save word files, browse the internet\' .. that kind of thing, because he didn\'t want to be left behind when the inevitable digital revolution came.\n\n\nSadly, I have no idea what went wrong there, but this course convinced him he knew *everything*. \nWhile normally a lovely person, the number of times he\'d call me up out of the blue to ask for advice on a computer issue he has, then to ignore it and tell me I don\'t know what I\'m talking about .. only for me to have to come over (it\'s a long drive) and fix it (seeing it was *exactly* what I said it was)... and then the cycle had begun.\n\nAnything that he broke a week later was my fault from my repairs the week before. And he was infallible, because *he* had taken a course in computering.\n\n"Have you taken a course in Computering, Findanniin?" he\'d ask.\n\n"No dad, I haven\'t - but really - you *must* have accepted or not unchecked a little box or installed *something* to have half your screen taken up by browser add-ons."\n\n"No son, *you* did it. This is new. I took a course in browsing the internet, I know what to look out for."\n\n\nIt was ... infuriating.'
###### b'I\'m not sure if the worst part of this is that the user couldn\'t find their shortcut because they renamed it or because they called it "Google Bing"...'
###### b">Caller: next time don't mess around with my computer! I know you guys changed this, I'm not stupid! I have a certificate of proficiency in computering\n\n>Me: okay thanks for calling click\n\nWell done for not snapping. Not sure if I would have managed."

###### b"Motorola call centre around 2002:\n\nAgent: Motorola how can I help you?\n\nCustomer: My cellphone isn't working. I can't make or receive any calls with it. It's completely dead.\n\nAgent: Can I get the serial number please? It's located under the battery.\n\nCustomer: Yeah, one second, I'll take the battery off.\n\n*call drops*\n\nThis happened at least once a week."
###### b'"I have a certificate of proficiency in computering" \n\nKill me. '

###### b'I need a t-shirt that says "Trust me, I have a certificate of proficiency in computering!" to be my new work uniform...  '
###### b'One of my clients kept referring to browsers as search engines. He was very specific about it, "*My* search engine, the Google Chrome, won\'t load your site properly," he used to say. Sometimes he\'d just say \'the Microsoft\' or \'the Google\' because he figured the support guys knew what was what. \n\nI know not every workplace is tech savvy, but this guy was working for a company that was full of developers. The owner was a programmer himself and still coded from time to time. How that guy got hired was a mystery. Why he was fired wasn\'t. '
###### b"What's so hard to understand about using a program called Google But It's Not Google"
###### b"I'm glad I don't do service desk. I'd be recording every call, and sending half to HR. "

## This one's a simple one, but I can't get it out of my head.
#### b'I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.\n\nA few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we\'ll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were "Third-party software, hard of hearing."\n\nI walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I\'ve been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs "yes" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he\'s been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.\n\nShe lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it\'s now been 1 year since Pete\'s seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.\n\nAs I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there\'s a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.\n\nOnce everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype\'s test call to ensure it wouldn\'t crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.\n\nI looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it\'d been 3-weeks since they\'d heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.\n\nIt\'s moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete\'s tablet, "fixing" it made me feel like a hero. It\'s been a few days and I can still see his smile.\n\nJust thought I\'d share, thanks for reading.\n\nObligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words. Seeing the response I\'ve gotten from all of you has made this experience even better! You guys are an amazing community.'

###### b'introducing old, isolated people (often widows) to the wonders of video calling and the internet at large was always a nice moment...\n\n"wait, you mean there\'s ALL THE BOOKS IN THE WORLD in this tiny thing ?"\n\nyes ma\'am, that\'s exactly what I meant.\n\n"can you put some recipe books in there for me ?"\n\nyes ma\'am, what kind ?\n\ncue a pie or other pastry coming in for me later that week...'
###### b'Semi related, I worked at a similar retail establishment and was helping an older man with his newish laptop. He had bad shakes and always used a plug in mouse because the touch pad was too difficult.\n\nHe made an offhand comment about how annoying it was that all these modern machines made text so small he could barely read. 10 seconds later I enlarged the text on his system, he was ecstatic. A minute later I was watching him try to click on something but he kept missing it because of his shakes. I went ahead and dropped the sensativity on his mouse a few notches. He literally cried.\n\nI know it sucks, but help your parents/grandparents. You have no idea what it means to them.'
###### b'Take all my upvotes. Fantastic story. I once got to help a couple of blind people with their computer issues, and while not nearly as heart-wrenching as your experience, it was still very rewarding to be able to assist people who had additional disadvantages beyond the norm, not to mention earning their trust and respect.'
###### b"As a deaf tech who used to assist deaf people whenever they come up the counter, I wish more techs were like you! \n\nGood job applying your ASL skills and there was one time when I was called for assistance to an emergency at a store in a different state so I flew over there and met the acting supervisor who will be supervising the store for a week. I was surprised to find out he know sign language and the HQ specifically requested him to accompany me because they knew I was deaf. \n\nWe got along really quick and it was smooth sailing at the store. At the end of the week, we went back to our home states and before we went our way, my acting supervisor told me to tell my supervisor that he needs to learn sign language because he felt that bosses should learn sign language if they have a deaf employee. He added that if my supervisor don't learn sign language, I should transfer over to his store! \n\nHe was awesome and he did share the same first and last name with a deceased, yet very famous musician.

###### b"I did online computer repair work for Geek Squad for a couple of years while I was back in school. One of the best days I've ever had happened among all the routine virus/malware removals.\n\nI get this call, and it's clearly an older woman, and she starts asking me questions about getting her laptop set up. I learn over the course of a few minutes that she's over 90, and her sister, also over 90, is with her. She's in New York, and her sister lives in Seattle, but is visiting for a few days. They'd heard about Skype and video chatting, and decided to go out and each buy a laptop.\n\nSo I walked each of them through connecting their laptops to me (which went smoothly ... some people think old people suck at technology, but they were my best clients, because they generally would actually listen and do what I asked one step at a time, instead of younger people who would often skip ahead to the wrong thing or otherwise do things that made us start over). Over the next hour or so, I installed Skype on both laptops, stretched the rules and created Skype accounts for them, and added them to each other's Skype. We then did the test call.\n\nTheir faces were so happy when they popped up on each others' screens. I had to tell them little things like tilting the laptop screen to adjust the camera, but they were so overjoyed. They asked over and over if it would work when sister 2 went home, and I kept telling them that as long as the internet connection was good, it would work and the individual calls were completely free.\n\nI didn't make my metrics that day, but it stands out as one of my best days on that job. I helped made a real, substantive change to a couple of people's lives, and they were so happy about it."

###### b'When I was a teenager I was working in a shop that sells all sorts of household stuff in the UK. I usually worked the complaints desk because I didn\'t mind it but everyone else hated it (people would often trade me their breaks if I did their CD shift for them) \n\nAnyway one day I\'m at my desk waiting for someone to show up when I hear my colleague a few tills down having difficulty with a customer. He was a teenager like me and we got along well so I wandered over to see what was up. His customer was lady in her early 20s who seemed like she was deaf from the way she talked and I could see that she was staring at his lips while he talked, but my friend always spoke very quickly so she couldn\'t tell what he was saying. I offered to take over and talked to her slowly and deliberately over pronounced my words so she could see all the shapes I was saying. \n\nTurns out she was looking for camping equipment so I helped her find what she was looking for, put the order through and helped her over at the collections desk (not my job usually). After everything was done she asked to speak to my manager and I thought "oh no! I\'ve overdone it and offended her!"  I was sure I was going to be fired. So my manager comes out and I walk away. \n\nA little while later my manager calls me into her office and tells me that the lady just wanted to tell her how grateful she was that I understood what was going on and put the effort into helping her. Apparently it really made a difference. \n\nThis happened 15 years ago and I still think back to it sometimes. It didn\'t take a lot effort for me to help her out but it made a difference to her. '
###### b'The guys at /r/wholesomememes would get a kick out of this story.'
###### b'I wish I was doing more work like this. 95% of the time folks come to me loaded with anger and don\'t care about the "Why" or "How" they just "Want it fixed now". I absolutely LOVE to get cases where the folks are calm and legitimately appreciate the help.\n\nMy favorite in the past 3 years was an older Korean gentleman. Really nice fella who worked as a maintenance man for a hotel chain out here. He had to let me into their server closet so I could repair and re-program a damaged wireless AP. So as I\'m finishing up re-programming their wireless mesh network and such, he wanders up to me with a remote and the instruction booklet. He had been struggling with the new TV remotes they upgraded to when they re-did all the rooms with new furniture and carpet and whatnot. He couldn\'t read english and there was no Korean in the booklet. \n\nAfter a few minutes of reading the pamphlet and fiddling with the remote to figure out the programming codes and such, got a method working to where he just kept pressing the power button until stuff turned on/off. Then he would press the function button again to program that code. He was just ECSTATIC that I was able to provide him with a methodology to the remotes. Shook my hand graciously, "Been angry all week! Very helpful! Very helpful!".\n\nAbsolutely love those types of jobs.'
###### b"Dammit, who's been chopping onions in the server room?!? "
###### b"I was an IT technician a while back and I loved my older customers; they'd be over the moon everytime I completed something for them and were always extremely grateful. Gave me tips as well! They always wanted to talk and have a conversation and were never in a rush like everyone else. It really made my day when I had an older customer, they're so damn nice to deal with.\n\nEdit: spelling etc"

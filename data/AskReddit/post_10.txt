## Anthony Bourdain once said "There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons. My life is a series of strategems, to avoid, and outwit that guy". Who is "that guy" for you, and what do you do to avoid him?
#### b''

###### b"I hate mornings. I don't like waking up. I don't like breakfast as a genre or activity. I don't see a good reason to be anywhere ever before 10am.\n\nI started forcing myself to wake up early and go to the gym before work. And i hate it so much but it makes me feel so goddam good all day long. It's a shitty healthy dose of morning endorphins that stops me from getting sleepy after lunch, keeps me energized after work, get a better night's sleep. \n\nIt sucks so much and it sucks even more that it improves every aspect of my day because now if i stop i know i'll just start having shitty bad days again and it'll be my dumbass lazy fault with a simple fix."
###### b'That guy wants to settle for anything out of fear of nothing better coming later. That guy is okay with the dead-end job, the abusive relationships and no master\'s degree. I tell that guy it\'s never gotten me anywhere, it\'s the definition of "stuck" and I have no intention of being stuck anymore.'
###### b"That guy's kicking my ass right now."
###### b'It used to be eat cheap pizza, chain smoke, and play video games. I changed a lot of those habits to healthier ones.'
###### b'I used to have a little sign on my desk that said "The worst possible feeling is when the person you are meets the person you could have been."  It was there to encourage to pursue my goals rather than procrastinate on games, Reddit, etc.  I think it\'s time I dug that sign out again.'
###### b'The guy who wants to go streaking during the Super Bowl halftime show. I avoid him by remembering that prison is not a pleasant place to be.'
###### b'That guy\xe2\x80\x99s cousin lives in my head, I go to AA meetings to avoid and outwit him.'
###### b'Bold of you to assume I avoid him.'
###### b"We came to an agreement and take turns occupying the same body. It's me from 5:30 am  to 5pm on weekdays. And he gets evenings,  weekends and holidays."
###### b"All that guy wants to do is do Reddit and play videogames.\n\nI don't do anything to avoid him."
###### b'He just wants to win the lottery and sit on his couch watching dark comedies, drinking until it kills him.\n\nI avoid this by remembering that my mother would be very sad if that happened, and that I want to love someone, like really be in love, at least one more time before I go.'
###### b"I have the same exact same guy in my head. I quit smoking pot years ago, before i hit 30. I can still stay in bed all day on some days. What keeps me from doing it (having a 24h lay in on my laptop) too often are commitments I've made to myself, friends, and employers. Back in the day pot made it really easy to give up on those commitments. I miss pot, but I don't miss those times in general, which keeps me from going back."
###### b'I have chronic severe depression, going 25 years now. It\'s not completely clear what I have but it comes and goes (not SAD, not bipolar, not mdd, we simply don\'t know and medication doesn\'t work). However, it\'s never really gone, it\'s more like manageable or unmanageable.\n\nThe voice is either telling me I should lie down and just give up, or it\'s telling me that soon I will be lying down and giving up again. My manageable moments are obviously filled with as much joy as I can pack in there, and every night before going to bed I tell the voice to suck it, today was my day, not yours.\n\nWhen it\'s unmanageable and the voice tells me to give up I try to fight him as long as I can, and when I start to agree with him I always manage to end it with "but not today".\n\nIt\'s kept me alive for this long, I hope I can keep going like this for awhile.'
###### b'That guy is my ADHD. I probably have an extreme case where my meds, which are at high doses, hardly even work anymore. The best way I combat this urge to do something fun, play games, or goof off is to remove myself from any place of temptation. Cut it off before you get the thought of even doing something pleasurable.        \n\nWhat I do is that I find empty classrooms at my college and study or do work in there. I will purposively drive away from my home (which is full of games, food, fun, and comfort) to a classroom just so I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the urge, and even if I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ve created a barrier that takes too much guilt and effort of driving back and doing something fun'
###### b'Might get buried, but my dude in my head is literally Mr. Spock from Star Trek, and I don\'t avoid him.\n\nHear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.\n\n\nMr. Spock: "The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful."\n\n\nKirk: "That\'s horrible!"\n\n\nSpock: "Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it\'s actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob."\n\n\nSo, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. \n\n\nme: "Spock, science report."\n\n\nSpock: "Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn\'t consciously aware of it, but he\'s attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes."\n\n\nme: "Thank you, Spock, sounds like I\'m being dishonest with myself. I suck!"\n\n\nSpock: "I disagree. It\'s entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You\'ve yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable."\n\n\nJust going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.\n\nEDIT: holy shit, I\'m happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I\'d offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don\'t have your expectations set correctly. \n\nOne - Spock\'s reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don\'t treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.\n\nTwo - You WILL fail, as well, and that\'s totally OK! He\'s analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that "getting gas" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn\'t come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior "science report", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, "godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal\'s psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*" Spock doesn\'t judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, "That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock." That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I\'m several months smoke free and still going!\n\nThree - this isn\'t to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it\'s all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.\n\nFour - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don\'t understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don\'t dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don\'t come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you\'ve more experience, time, and data.'

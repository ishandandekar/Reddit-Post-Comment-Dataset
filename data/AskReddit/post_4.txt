## How would you feel about a feature where if someone upvotes a crosspost, the original post is upvoted automatically?
#### b''

###### b'what about subs that crosspost from other subs to mock them?'
###### b'The karmaceutical companies would be outraged.'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'It would be weird to see a post in a smaller subreddit with thousands of points just because it got crossposted somewhere more popular.'
###### b'[removed]'
###### b"The thing is that a good post on one sub might be a bad post on another. If something is relevant in one sub but irrelevant in another, the downvotes from the sub where it's not relevant would take upvotes from the post that's highly relevant."
###### b'Will totally lead to abuse'
###### b'Would prevent karma theft'
###### b'Are imaginary points really that important to you?'
###### b'Ehh, sometimes you crosspost because OP was a dick, so no'
###### b'Different subs exist for different content.\n\nshould upvotes on /r/watchpeopledie boost a troll post to /r/aww ?'
###### b'What about downvotes?'
###### b'Too many ways to abuse that system. You would have people cross-posting their shitposts all over the place.'
###### b"Karma farmers will just download and reupload the image before posting instead of using the crosspost function.       Regardless, I think it'd be a nice feature."
###### b'I dunno OP how would you feel about world peace?'

## Reddit, how would you feel about a law that bans radio stations from playing commercials with honking/beeping/siren noises in them?
#### b''

###### b'I would feel like "finally. Lawmakers taking the public\'s issues to heart."'
###### b'I agree, and any ad for a auto service shop that plays squealing brakes or ominous engine sounds as well. '
###### b'Reddit, how do you feel about [common Reddit opinion]?\n\nEdit: The fact that this is #3 for top of this year astounds me.'
###### b'[deleted]'
###### b'Also doorbells on commercials because my dogs.'
###### b'I was driving one day and listening to a very popular radio station in my region. And I saw all cars around me on the highway swerve a little bit when a commercial with sirens came on. Very dangerous stuff if you ask me.\n\nEdit: in the city close to where I live carnival is very popular and very well known, for about one month each year the festival gets their own radio station with loud obnoxious party music that is quite funny. Swerve is maybe an exaggeration but I saw the reaction of many drivers in my vicinity since the siren came on quite loud after the news bulletin.'
###### b'I want to ban AskReddit posts about shit everyone will agree with '
###### b'You see this kind of question so often, everyone already agrees with the post anyway, it contributes nothing and is blatant karma whoring'
###### b'Redditors, what are your thoughts on low hanging fruit Ask Reddit questions and diamonds and vaccines?'
###### b'This is the most circle jerk post I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a very long time'
###### b'Reddit, do you think water is wet?'
###### b'Oh fuck off i hate these posts, yes people want this, get out of here'
###### b"I'd be fine with it.  Hell, I'd encourage the ban.  I flinch whenever those commercials are played."
###### b'This is a bad post. You\xe2\x80\x99re asking a leading question that an overwhelmingly majority already agrees with. \n\nReddit, how would you feel if we had hovercars that didn\xe2\x80\x99t run on gas'

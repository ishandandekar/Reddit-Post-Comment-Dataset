## Would you watch a show where a billionaire CEO has to go an entire month on their lowest paid employees salary, without access to any other resources than that of the employee? What do you think would happen?
#### b''

###### b"They'd be fine.\n\nThe problem with poverty is not usually day-to-day costs. People can adjust to that.  It's unexpected expenses that are crippling.\n\n~~*Edit: Why are people still responding two weeks later! Nobody is reading this thread any more! At least not the responses at the bottom*~~ (Edit2: rant was too whiney. If you have something to say, who am I to say otherwise?)"
###### b'It would be better if they had to live *with* their lowest salaried employee for a month or two, imo.   \nIn their house, dinner with the family, travel to and from work together, same lunch, kids with homework, the works.\n\nBuilding that relation would imo do much more for this problem than just "experiencing below your normal standard of living before returning to it"..   \nYou\'re more likely to feel empathy for a family you know, and much less likely to forget them.\n\nAnything else would just be another show about *wealthy people having a fun adventure to talk about at cocktail parties*'
###### b'I doubt a month is enough to really feel the effect'
###### b"It would be incredibly self-serving and boring. They would never truly experience what it is like to be in the precarious position of a minimum wage employee living hand-to-mouth and the 'novelty' is just salt in the wound. \n\nIt would be more interesting to see the reverse."
###### b"There was this similar themed show in Hongkong and Mainland China years ago.\n\nThey swapped billionare with bottom feeders, let the rich do the basical job, on the lowest salary, to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort. \n\nNearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere, regardless of how hard they worked, even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society.\n\nThere was only despair, and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense.\n\nIt stirred big debate among the society back then, and I think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled .\n\nThere was also another show in China, swapping senior political figures with community level council workers, to see how good they could do in each other's posts. The mayors were flooded by the angry mobs who kept asking for more and more benefits that were impossible to fullfil, by the end had to admit the amount of work at basic community level was too much to archieve anywhere.\n\nThe show also got cancelled quite soon after a few episodes."
###### b"3 months minimum and I'd watch it\n\nThanks for the gold!!"
###### b'I love Reality shows so I\'d watch it depending on who produces it. \n\nIf it\'s too fake, with too many "emotional" moments, advertising and people shouting, I\'m out.'
###### b'It\xe2\x80\x99s more than just the money. It\xe2\x80\x99s the lack of security these people endure. Not knowing if you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose your job tomorrow and having no savings. Being kicked out of your home. An unexpected bill you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford, which may lead to increasing debt. \n\nPutting these rich people in a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d lifestyle for a month isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. Even if they lost their money and homes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have such a huge network that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be back on their feet in the time it takes for us peons to earn enough to eat for a week. They can never truly understand what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be poor or ever face that reality again. \n\nSo what would happen? It\xe2\x80\x99d be a completely self-serving advert about how \xe2\x80\x9cnow I realise that we need to do more for our employees.\xe2\x80\x9d The workers get a small vanity bonus, probably give an immigrant worker with limited English a car, pat themselves on the back. Then two weeks later, we\xe2\x80\x99ve all forgotten about the show and they\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to their old ways.'
###### b'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this almost the same as secret millionaire? Do you guys have that in the US?'
###### b"Lots of rich people voluntarily go on vacation to third world countries. The catch is, they know they have a way out and an end date. \n\nI'd be interested to watch a show where the CEO had to personally be financially responsible for the welfare of 50% of their lowest payed employees for 10 years, and their net growth percentage equalled their bonus every year, with a big bonus if both the company and the employees were profitable at the end."
###### b"Sure. They would never do that though, because then they would have to admit that they don't pay a living wage."
###### b'I\'d do more than a month and without any contact to rich buddies either. If it\'s a month, I think a lot would just buy rice and beans every day and go "See? It\'s super easy to be poor! You just need to make economical choices! I\'ve proven myself right!" Longer than that and they\'ll really have to get used to how their lowest paid employees live. Would they learn a lesson? Maybe. Likely not. They still have a mansion to come back home to. They\'ll give their lowest paid people a one time bonus or maybe they\'ll drag one out in front of a camera to give them a fancy car so their own reputation gets better. And then they won\'t change anything else.'
###### b"1 month isn't long enough because no rent is due etc."
###### b"They wouldn't have any trouble. Most of them are self made and most have a large number of financial skills that 99% of people don't. They'd micro their finances and come out better off than most people.\n\nYou think someone like Jeff Bezos, or Bill Gates, or Elon Musk couldn't handle it? Or what about Warren Buffet? The dude is already living a modest life.\n\nA lot of dumbasses in the comments seem to fail to realize that a lot of these billionaires were already in a super shitty position before, and pulled themselves out of it.\n\nThese people run massive corporations and charities and you dumbasses seriously think that living your life for a few months would be a challenge? That's some cringe."
###### b"You should watch Undercover Billionaire on Discovery (not to be confused with Undercover Boss). Billionaire Glenn Stearns moves to Erie PA with just $100, a truck and no contacts and has to make a company valued at $1 million in 90 days. He also can't mention who he is to anyone. It's pretty much exactly like you are describing and insanely entertaining."

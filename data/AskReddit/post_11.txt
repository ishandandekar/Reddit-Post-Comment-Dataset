#### b''

###### b'Bro, I got a new phone and was trying to login on my old account. I was so confused when nothing worked. I was tired of this and went on Reddit to see this. At least I know the reason.'
###### b"Well I work for T-mobile as tech support so my entire day has basically been ''yeah that's not us and it's not your fault'', but seeing a little more activity on reddit is nice. lol"
###### b"With the influx of visitors it's only a matter of time before Reddit servers also go down"
###### b"MySpace is working fine   :)   Just sayin'"
###### b'I was wondering why i kept seeing the same 5 posts on facebook lmfao'
###### b'Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know they were down but that explains why my friend stopped replying all of a sudden\xe2\x80\xa6 I hope'
###### b'For a change it\xe2\x80\x99s not reddit thats down'
###### b"Didn't know they were down but that explains why I haven't heard from my sister yet today. \n\nThanks, dude."
###### b'As long as i have something to scroll endlessly with ads and strong opinions I feel alive.'
###### b"I thought my internet was the problem. Turns out the universe is just sending me a sign to stop mindlessly scrolling through someone else's timeline."
###### b"Oh, I kept trying to refresh my feed on Insta and it wouldn't work.   \n\n\nWelp, it's pretty nice here."
###### b'I thought my wifi was stupid'
###### b"I already exhausted all of my usual subs hours before this happened. The internet is dead to me.\n\nEDIT: Hey mom, you said I'd never amount to anything. Well, look at me now."
###### b'Interesting that it happens the very next day after the "60 Minutes" interview with Facebook whistleblower.\n\nArticle:  Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s very, very bad day: Services go down as stock plunges in wake of whistleblower revelations.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-very-very-bad-day-services-go-down-as-stock-plunges-in-wake-of-whistleblower-revelations-11633365581?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-very-very-bad-day-services-go-down-as-stock-plunges-in-wake-of-whistleblower-revelations-11633365581?siteid=yhoof2)'

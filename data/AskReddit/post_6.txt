###### b'Not only did this man create an empire that almost everyone loves, but he was a genuine man who just loved to see people smile. \n\nI had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  \n\nI remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. \n\nOr how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves "what I didn\'t hear you!" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  \n\nMy time with him was short, but I\'m so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.   \n\nRIP Stan.

###### b"Was really hoping he'd get to see Avengers 4, but at least he did get to see and interact with his creations on the big screen.\n\nRIP.\n\n"
###### b'His wife passed away not too long ago, too. It must have been lonely to all of a sudden be without his life partner...'
###### b'A friend and I snuck into a premiere party for a movie. That\xe2\x80\x99s an r/actlikeyoubelong story on its own. But we spotted Stan Lee, surrounded by a posse. A lot of pretty girls and some serious handlers. Here we were, just average idiots in a place we weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be. \n\nWe approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.\n\nStill have the photo, and a nice memory of a pretty great guy who was good to his fans. \n\nEdit: https://i.imgur.com/vFRhI78.jpg\n'
###### b'He was the highest grossing actor of all time if you include cameos and supporting actors!'
###### b'Seriously, there was a thread in here I was reading earlier on today about who you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe is still alive and someone mentioned Stan Lee. \n\nNo frickin way. '
###### b"I'm 40+ years of age. When I was growing up, all the Marvel comics I read featured Stan's Soapbox, a short column where he would write about whatever was on his mind. It was like a personal letter every month, and always did such a good job of welcoming all into this little club of misfits and weirdos. \n\nStan is different than most of my heroes in that when I think of him, I'm always 13 again."
###### b'I guess over the next few years we will see how many future cameos were filmed early. It will be nice to still see him and know that there is more to look forward to'
###### b'[removed]'
###### b"Good bye to a great mind. Between him and Hawking it's been a terrible year. Both changed the world in their own ways."
###### b'Since I grew up with superheroes and their ideas of morals, protecting the innocent, ect. I feel like it really shaped me morally, and gave me an interest in criminology and upholding the law. RIP Stan Lee!'
###### b"This sounds pretty stereotypical, but it means a lot to me...\n\nI grew up in a family with two alcoholic parents and likely abuse-related early onset mental illness. My reality was incredibly bleak from a very young age. One day, I got my hands on an anthology of the original *Amazing Spiderman* comics. Every morning and every night when I got home from school I cracked open that anthology and read each and every comic again and again and again. Stan Lee gave me a healthy escape to a world where all loose ends tied up nicely, where the bad guys always lost, where I knew I was safe.\n\nRest in peace Mr. Lee. Thank you for everything you've done for me and the likely tens of  thousands like me. "
###### b"I'll repeat in what I said in another thread but shortly. He used his platform for selfless purposes and he always stood up for the minority in the face of bigotry. Captain America fought Nazi's, Iron Man was an Alcoholic War vet, the X-Men represented those who had been misunderstood and cast out by society and it's all too alienating standards. Power Man a black man whose skin was his power defended Harlem. REST IN PEACE STAN LEE!!! YOU WERE AWESOME!!!"
###### b'Damn one last cameo in Endgame made me cry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRIP to a real one'

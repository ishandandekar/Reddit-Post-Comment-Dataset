###### b'[Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/34.3,173.91/4)\n\nIt allows you to see plane traffic live'
###### b"https://www.freecycle.org its litterly people giving away stuff they dont need/want any more that they can't/don't care enough to sell"
###### b'1aauto.com\n\nIt is a car parts supplier, but their videos show exactly what tools you need, what parts you need, and how to do a repair yourself. Great money saver if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about mechanics. Someone I knew was going to get screwed by their mechanic (700 bucks for a water pump replacement). Showed them that, they did it themselves for 30 bucks. It makes it quicker too, knowing what tools you need ahead of time for your particular car.\n\nEdit: I agree they\xe2\x80\x99re not the best for parts, this was just about their videos. For parts, rockauto.com is great. If you need an item quicker and have an Advanced Auto nearby, order online and pick up in store. They almost ALWAYS have a coupon online for at least 20% off, which you can apply and pick up in store, around 30 minutes later, yet save quite a bit versus just going in and buying.\n\nLast edit: For those that are not mechanically inclined and do not want to mess with it, use Repairpal.com when you receive a quote and make sure the price is reasonable. It will give you a pretty general idea of what you should be paying in your area. It\xe2\x80\x99s not 100%, but will help keep you from getting ripped off. Unfortunately, there are a lot of shops that will take advantage of a situation. Not saying all, of course, but that way you will know for sure. Thanks for the silver, as well!'

###### b"If you're in the USA and you earn less than a certain amount of money -- currently $69,000 -- you can use the same software to file your taxes [for free](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free).\n\nThe system is called [Free File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free), and companies that sell you tax software [are trying very hard to make it difficult to find](https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines). Don't let them."
